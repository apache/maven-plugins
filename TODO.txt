release maven-invoker 2.0.10 so we can consume the new --reactor feature
integration tests
deal with sibling aggregators (which use <module>../blah</module>) ... can we do that with -r?  Should we generate a temporary POM instead?
basic unit test - would require injecting ProjectSorter (can somebody give me a hint?)
graduate from sandbox
make a reverse dependency tree
