Running Individual Unit Tests

 Since version 2.1 of the Ant Plugin, the generated Ant build files allow to run individual unit tests. You merely need
 to specify the simple name of the desired test class via the system property <<<test>>> as illustrated below:

+-----+
ant test -Dtest=MyFavoriteTest
+-----+

 This will run a test matching the pattern <<<**/MyFavoriteTest.java>>>. You can also employ a simple pattern to select
 multiple tests:
 
+-----+
ant test -Dtest=*FavoriteTest
+-----+

 <<Note>>: Unlike the Surefire Plugin, the Ant scripts do not support a comma-separated value for the <<<test>>> property.
