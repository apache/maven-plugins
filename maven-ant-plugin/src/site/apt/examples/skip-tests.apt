Skipping Unit Tests

 Although not recommended as a general practice, you sometimes may want to skip the unit tests when packaging the
 artifact. Starting with Ant Plugin 2.1, the generated Ant build files allow this via the system property
 <<<maven.test.skip>>>:

+-----+
ant package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
+-----+

 The above command will both skip the compilation of the unit tests and their execution.
