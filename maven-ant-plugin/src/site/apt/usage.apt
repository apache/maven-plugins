Usage

 The Ant Plugin generates Ant build files from POMs. The following example describe the basic
 usage of the Plugin.

* Generate Ant build files

 To generate files, you execute the <<<ant>>> goal of the Ant Plugin, i.e.:

+-----+
mvn ant:ant
+-----+

 The following files should be created:

+-----+
yourProjectBaseDir
|-- build.xml
|-- maven-build.xml
`-- maven-build.properties
+-----+

** build.xml

 The <<<build.xml>>> file is a generic Ant build file. It can be updated by the user.
 Here is the out-of-box <<<build.xml>>>:

+-----+
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
<!-- Ant build file (http://ant.apache.org/) for Ant 1.6.2 or above.        -->
<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<project name="%PROJECT_ARTIFACTID%" default="jar" basedir=".">

  <!-- ====================================================================== -->
  <!-- Import maven-build.xml into the current project                        -->
  <!-- ====================================================================== -->

  <import file="maven-build.xml"/>

  <!-- ====================================================================== -->
  <!-- Help target                                                            -->
  <!-- ====================================================================== -->

  <target name="help">
    <echo message="Please run: $ant -projecthelp"/>
  </target>
</project>
+-----+

 <<Note>>: By default, the <<<build.xml>>> file is not overwritten when calling <<<mvn ant:ant>>>.
 If you want to overwrite it,
 you should execute the <<<ant>>> goal with the <<<overwrite>>> parameter, i.e.:

+-----+
mvn ant:ant -Doverwrite=true
+-----+

** maven-build.xml

 The <<<maven-build.xml>>> file is an Ant build file for your project. It contains several targets to clean, compile,
 test and package your project and also to create javadoc. To see which Ant targets are available execute this command:

+-----+
ant -projecthelp
+-----+

 <<Warning>>: Do not edit <<<maven-build.xml>>>! It will be overwritten when calling <<<mvn ant:ant>>>.

** maven-build.properties

 The <<<maven-build.properties>>> file contains several properties used by the <<<maven-build.xml>>> build file.

 <<Warning>>: Do not edit <<<maven-build.properties>>>! It will be overwritten when calling <<<mvn ant:ant>>>.
