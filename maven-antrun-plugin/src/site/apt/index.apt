Maven AntRun Plugin

  This plugin provides the ability to run Ant tasks from within Maven2. You can
  even embed your ant scripts in the POM!

  It is <not> the intention of this plugin to provide a means of polluting the
  POM, so it's encouraged to move all your Ant tasks to a <<<build.xml>>> file
  and just call it from the POM using Ant's
  {{{http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/ant.html}\<ant/\> task}}.

  One of the main purposes of this plugin is to facilitate the migration from Ant
  based projects to Maven 2. Some projects may not currently be able to migrate
  because they depend on custom build functionality that Maven 2 doesn't provide
  by default.

* Goals Overview

  General Information about the goals.
