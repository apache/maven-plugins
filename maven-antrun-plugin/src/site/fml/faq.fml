     <question>Why use antrun and not the ant program itself?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>Maven has certain benefits over Ant. And for your ant projects to take
       advantage of these, you can use Maven as your project management tool and
       use its maven-antrun-plugin to build your ant projects. </p>
       <p>Furthermore, if you wish to migrate from ant to Maven, you can use 
       this plugin first, then gradually convert your ant expressions into their
       corresponding Maven expressions.</p>
