        This plugin provides the ability to run Ant tasks from
        within Maven2. You can even embed your ant scripts in the POM!
      </p>

      <p>
        It is <emph>not</emph> the intention of this plugin to provide a means
        of polluting the POM, so it's encouraged to move all your
        Ant tasks to a build.xml file and just call it from the POM
        using Ant's <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/ant.html">&lt;ant/&gt; task</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the main goals of this plugin is to ease the migration from 
        Ant based projects to Maven 2. A lot of projects are currently unable
        to migrate simply because they depend on some custom build functionality
        that Maven2 doesn't provide yet.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Even with plugins widely available there will always be simple, small
        tasks that can be done using one or two lines of Ant script (like
        deploying an EAR), until ofcourse a plugin comes available that does
        the job.
