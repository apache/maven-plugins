Assembly Plugin Required Docs

* Component Descriptors:
      o include in usage.html:
            + how are they used?
            + what can they specify?
      o include examples of usage
* Advanced Assembly Descriptor Topics: new page
      o ModuleSet improvements
            + module-set-level includes/excludes
            + includeModuleDirectory
            + excludeSubModuleDirectories
            + outputDirectoryMapping at the module level
            + sources vs. binaries sections
                  # binaries: attachmentClassifier to look at certain attached 
                    artifacts for a module
                  # binaries: dependencySets section to specify which module 
                    deps to include
                  # includes/excludes still present for backward compat ONLY
            + fileSets subsection (?)
      o FileSet improvements
            + useDefaultExcludes
      o baseDirectory to provide alternate basedir for the root dir of the 
        assembly
      o useStrictFiltering -> Added to SetBase, so all dependency sets and 
        module sets, etc. can use to fail the build on unused filters in those sets.
* Examples:
      o Update all multi-module examples to reflect improvements in <sources> 
        and <binaries> sections.
      o Add examples for include/exclude wildcards
            + including filtering out artifacts with a certain classifier or 
              type using wildcards
      o More?
