/**
 * Like the <code>assembly:attached</code> goal, assemble an application bundle 
 * or distribution using an assembly descriptor from the command line.
 * This goal will force Maven to build all included POMs up to the <code>package</code> phase BEFORE
 * the assembly is processed. This goal
 * differs from <code>assembly:assembly</code> in that it ignores the &lt;formats/&gt;
 * section of the assembly descriptor, and forces the assembly to be created as
 * a directory in the project's build-output directory (usually <code>./target</code>).
 * <br/>
 * 
 * This goal is also functionally equivalent to using the <code>assembly:assembly</code>
 * goal in conjunction with the <code>dir</code> assembly format.
 * <br/>
 *
 * <b>NOTE:</b> This goal should ONLY be run from the command line, and if building a multimodule project 
 * it should be used from the root POM. Use the <code>assembly:directory-single</code> goal for binding 
 * your assembly to the lifecycle.
