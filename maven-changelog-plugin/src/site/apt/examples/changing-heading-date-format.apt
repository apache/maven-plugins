Changing the Heading Date Format

  If you are using one of the types <<<date>>> or <<<range>>>, the headings of
  the reports will have dates in them. Starting with version 2.1 of the plugin,
  it is possible to configure the format of these dates.

  This is done with the <<<\<headingDateFormat\>>>> configuration element. It
  takes a string of characters, the same that is used in the
  {{{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html}SimpleDateFormat}}
  class, and uses them to format the dates in the headings to your liking.
