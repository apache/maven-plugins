Using Date Type

  To generate the changelog reports showing what has changed between two dates,
  you should use the "date" <<<type>>>.

  With the following configuration, the generated reports will cover SCM
  activities between Aug 1, 2005 to Sept 1, 2005. Please note that the date
  range is inclusive.

  <<Note:>> The <<<\<dateFormat\>>>> configuration is used <<only>> when
  parsing the dates that come from your SCM. It is <<not>> used to format the
  dates in the report.
