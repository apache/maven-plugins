Using Date Type

  To generate the changelog reports using the <<<type>>> "date" as the basis for generation, set the configuration in the
  project pom as follows:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-changelog-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <type>date</type>
          <dates>
            <date implementation="java.lang.String">2005-08-01</date>
            <date implementation="java.lang.String">2005-09-01</date>
          </dates>
          <dateFormat>yyyy-MM-dd</dateFormat>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>

  The generated changelog reports will cover SCM activities between Aug 1, 2005 to Sept 1, 2005. Please note that the
