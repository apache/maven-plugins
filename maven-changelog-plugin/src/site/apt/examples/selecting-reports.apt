Selecting Reports

  The plugin normally generates 3 reports: <<<changelog>>>, <<<dev-activity>>>
  and <<<file-activity>>>. By default all three reports are generated. It is
  possible to configure the plugin so that only a few of these reports are
  generated. This is done using <<<\<reportSets\>>>>.

  The following configuration will generate only the <<<changelog>>> and
  <<<file-activity>>> reports.

  <<Note:>> The <<<reportSets>>> element is not part of the <<<configuration>>>
  element. Instead, the <<<configuration>>> is found inside the
  <<<reportSet>>> element.
