Maven Changelog Plugin

 The Maven Changelog Plugin generates reports regarding the recent changes in your Software Configuration Management or SCM.
 These reports include the changelog report, developer activity report and the file activity report.

* Goals Overview

   The Changelog Plugin has three goals:

   * {{{changelog-mojo.html}changelog:changelog}} generates the changelog report. The changelog report shows all the SCM activities
     including the dates, files, and author of the revisions that occurred during the specified change sets.

   * {{{dev-activity-mojo.html}changelog:dev-activity}} generates the developer activity report. The dev-activity report shows a
     summary of the total commits, and the number of files changed of each developer listed in the project descriptor.

   * {{{file-activity-mojo.html}changelog:file-activity}} generates the file activity report. The file-activity report lists all
     files that we're revised during the specified change set.  It is arranged in a way where the file with the most number of revisions is listed first.

* Usage

   Instructions on how to use the Changelog Plugin can be found {{{usage.html}here}}.

* Examples

   The following examples show how to use the Changelog Plugin in more advanced use-cases:

   * {{{examples/configuration-date-type.html}Using Date Type}}

   * {{{examples/configuration-range-type.html}Using Range Type}}

   * {{{examples/configuration-tag-type.html}Using Tag Type}}
