Usage

 The reports may use either range, date, or tag as basis in generating the reports. Only one can be set. The change sets then
 can be configured by setting the correct parameter depending on the type chosen.  If <<<type>>> "date" is chosen, then the parameter
 <<<date>>> should contain the values of the set ranges.  This goes for "range" and "tag" types as well.

 To generate the changelog reports, just add the following in your project's pom:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>changelog-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 Aside from the required plugin configuration parameters needed to generate the reports, all reports will refer to the scm
 elements inside the project descriptor for other details regarding the connection to the project's scm. An example of the
 scm element inside the pom.xml is as follows:

-------------------
<project>
  ...
    <scm>
      <connection>scm:svn:http://server/path/to/project/trunk</connection>
      <developerConnection>scm:svn:https://path/to/project/trunk</developerConnection>
      <url>scm:svn:http://server/path/to/view/trunk</url>
    </scm>
  ...
</project>
-------------------

 Please refer to the Maven project descriptor for the description of the scm elements. It can be found
 {{{http://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html}here}}.

 When you execute <<<mvn site>>>, you will see that the changelog, dev-activity and file-activity reports are included in
 the generated site.
