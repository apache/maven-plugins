      <question>What is the difference between the Changelog plugin and the Changes plugin?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        The Changelog plugin generates reports based on the changes in the Software Configuration Management or SCM while
        the Changes plugin generates reports either from a changes.xml file or from the JIRA issue management system.
        For more information about the changes plugin, see
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-changes-plugin/">http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-changes-plugin</a>

      <question>What is Software Configuration Management or SCM?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        According to Roger Pressman (in his book) Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach, SCM is a <em>"set of activities
        designed to control change by identifying the work products that are likely to change, establishing relationships among
        them, defining mechanisms for managing different versions of these work products, controlling the changes imposed, and
        auditing and reporting on the changes made."</em>

      <question>Why do the dates look weird in the report when I use the dateFormat parameter?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The <code>dateFormat</code> parameter is used when parsing the dates
          from the log entries retrieved from your SCM system. It can
          <strong>not</strong> be used to format the dates in the report. If
          you try to do this the parsed dates will be wrong and the dates in
          the report even more so. They can look like this
          <code>0020-05-27</code> for a file that was changed on 14 december
          2005.
