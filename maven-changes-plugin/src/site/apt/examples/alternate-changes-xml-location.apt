Alternate Location for the <<<changes.xml>>> File

 <<Note:>> This feature was introduced in version <2.0-beta-2> of the Changes
 plugin.

 <<Note:>> Unless you have a specific reason to have your <<<changes.xml>>>
 file in a different location, we advice you to put it in the default location
 <<<$\{basedir\}/src/changes/changes.xml>>>. If nothing else, it saves you from
 having to configure it.

 If you <really> want to have your <<<changes.xml>>> in another location than
 the default location, you can do this by configuring your <<<pom.xml>>>. In
 this example we want to use the file <<<$\{basedir\}/src/site/changes.xml>>>:

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <xmlPath>${basedir}/src/site/changes.xml</xmlPath>
        </configuration>
        <reportSets>
          <reportSet>
            <reports>
              <report>changes-report</report>
            </reports>
          </reportSet>
        </reportSets>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
