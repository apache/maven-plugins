Validate your changes file

 Since 2.1, a {{{../changes-validate-mojo.html}mojo}} is now provided a schema file and a mojo is now 
 provided to validate your changes file.\
 You can attach this mojo to the pre-site phase.

* Configuring the Plugin

 First you must configure the plugin and tell it to validate your changes file.
