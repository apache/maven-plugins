Configuring the Trac Report

* Configuring your Trac instance

 The plugin needs to be told details of your Trac installation so that i
 can connect and query the open tickets.  The Trac installation needs to be 
 accessible via no authentication, basic authentication or NTLM authentication, 
 if you've used form authentication then you are out of luck.
 
 Your Trac installation needs to have the {{{http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin}XML-RPC plugin}}
 installed and working for this plugin to be able to read the tickets. 

** Basic Report Configuration

 The most basic report configuration is read from the <<<\<issueManagement\>>>> section
 of your pom.  This should work with no additional configuration, but by default all ticket
 will be listed
 
+-----------------+
  <issueManagement>
    <system>trac</system>
    <url>http://mytracserver.local/trac/MYPROJECT/</url>
  </issueManagement>
+-----------------+

** Configuring a Custom Query
 
 The exact query can configured in the <<<\<query\>>>> element.  
 See {{{http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracQuery}TracQuery}} for the exact syntax.

+-----------------+
  ...
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.1</version>
    <configuration>
      <query>status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;order=priority&amp;component=${project.artifactId}</query>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
  ...
+-----------------+


** Configuring Basic Authentication

 If your Trac is protected by basic authentication then you'll need to add 
 the <<<\<tracUser\>>>> and <<<\<tracPassword\>>>> configuration elements
 so that the pluign knows who to authenticate as.
 
+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.1</version>
        <configuration>
          <tracUser>my username</tracUser>
          <tracPassword>my password</tracPassword>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+


** Configuring NTLM Authentication

 If you have your Trac sitting behind Apache on Windows with mod_sspi 
 doing authentication with Active Directory, then the plugin should 
 authenticate to the server as the current use without any extra config.
 No <<<\<tracUser\>>>> and <<<\<tracPassword\>>>> configuration elements 
 are needed.

** Using custom encoding

 If you have to support non-western encodings, then specify an <<<\<outputEncoding\>>>> in the 
 configuration.

        <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.1</version>
        <configuration>
          ...
          <outputEncoding>Windows-31J</outputEncoding>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
