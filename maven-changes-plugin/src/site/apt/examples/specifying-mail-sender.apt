Specifying the Mail Sender

 The identify used to send the announcement mail can be customized. It can be
 either a member of the <<<\<developers\>>>> section of the pom or it can be
 specified explicitly with the <<<\<mailSender\>>>> parameter of the plugin.

* Specifying the developer to use

 To specify which developer is used to send the announcement, simply specify the <<<id>>> of
 the developer as in the example below:

+-----------------+
<project>
  <developers>
    ...
    <developer>
      <id>jsmith</id>
      <name>John Smith</name>
      <email>jsmith@foo.bar</email>
    </developer>
    ...
  </developers>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <fromDeveloperId>jsmith</fromDeveloperId>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+

 If no developer <<<id>>> is specified, the first <<<\<developer\>>>> in the list will be used.

 You can also do this from the command line, if the person doing the release
 changes between releases.

+-----------------+
mvn -Dchanges.fromDeveloperId=jsmith announcement-mail
+-----------------+


* Specifying the sender explicitly

 If you want to specify the sender explicitly and not rely on the <<<developers>>> section of your pom,
 define the <<<mailSender>>> parameter of the plugin.

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <mailSender>
            <name>Release Notification</name>
            <email>noreply@foo.bar</email>
          </mailSender>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+
