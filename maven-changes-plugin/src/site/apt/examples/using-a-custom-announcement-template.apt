Using a Custom Announcement Template

 The announcement Mojo uses a {{{http://velocity.apache.org/}Velocity}}
 template to create an announcement. If you want to, you can create your own
 custom template.

* Configuring the Plugin

 First you must configure the plugin and tell it where your template is. In
 this example we want to use the template
 <<<${basedir}/src/main/resources/our-announcements/my-announcement.vm>>>.

 <<Note:>> The <<<templateDirectory>>> must be a subdirectory of
 <<<${basedir}/src/main/resources/>>>.

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <template>my-announcement.vm</template>
          <templateDirectory>our-announcements</templateDirectory>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+

* Creating Your Template

 Next you want to create your own template. A wise thing is to start with the
 default one that is included in the plugin. You can download it from
 Subversion
 {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugins/trunk/maven-changes-plugin/src/main/resources/org/apache/maven/plugin/announcement/announcement.vm}here}}.
 It will provide you with examples on how to iterate over the actions of a
 release among other things.

* Available Variables

 Here's a list of the variables that you have at your disposal, when creating
 your own template:

*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| <<Variable>>    | <<Type>> | <<Contents>>
*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| releases*       | List     | All the releases from either the changes.xml file or from JIRA.
*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| groupId*        | String   | The groupId from your project's pom.
*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| artifactId*     | String   | The artifactId from your project's pom.
*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| version*        | String   | The version from your project's pom.
*-----------------+----------+-------------+

*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| release*        | Release  | The release that you are announcing.
*-----------------+----------+-------------+
<Variables marked with * are read-only.>

 Each <<<Release>>> also has a set of variables:

*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| <<Variable>>    | <<Type>> | <<Contents>>
*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| action*         | List     | All actions that were completed in this release.
*-----------------+----------+-------------+

*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| version*        | String   | The version of this release.
*-----------------+----------+-------------+
<Variables marked with * are read-only.>

 Finally each <<<Action>>> has its own set of variables:

*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| <<Variable>>    | <<Type>> | <<Contents>>
*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| action*         | String   | What was done.
*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| dev*            | String   | The developer who made the change.
*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| dueTo*          | String   | If this was a contribution from a non-developer, the name of that person.
*-----------------+----------+-------------+

*-----------------+----------+-------------+
| type*           | String   | What kind of change was this.
*-----------------+----------+-------------+
<Variables marked with * are read-only.>
