Maven 2 Changes Plugin

  This plugin is used to inform your users of the changes that have occured
  between different releases of your project. The plugin can extract these
  changes, either from a <<<changes.xml>>> file or from the JIRA issue
  management system, and present them as a report. You also have the option of
  creating a release announcement and even sending this via email to your
  users.
