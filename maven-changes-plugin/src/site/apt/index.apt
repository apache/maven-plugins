Maven 2 Changes Plugin

  This plugin is used to inform your users of the changes that have occured
  between different releases of your project. The plugin can extract these
  changes, either from a <<<changes.xml>>> file or from the JIRA issue
  management system, and present them as a report. You also have the option of
  creating a release announcement and even sending this via email to your
  users.

* Goals Overview

  * {{{announcement-mail-mojo.html}changes:announcement-mail}} send a release announcement via email.

  * {{{announcement-generate-mojo.html}changes:announcement-generate}} generate a release announcement.

  * {{{changes-report-mojo.html}changes:changes-report}} create a report showing what has changed between different releases of the project.

  * {{{jira-report-mojo.html}changes:jira-report}} create a report from issues downloaded from JIRA.
  
  * {{{changes-validate-mojo.html.html}changes:changes-validate}} validate the <<<changes.xml>>> file.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could

  the mail archive.

  {{{issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
