Usage

 This plugin is used to create a Changes Report, a JIRA Report and an
 Announcement text file. It is also able to send the announcement via email.


*How to Generate the Changes Report

 In order to use this goal, simply create a <<<changes.xml>>> file in the <<<src/changes/>>> directory.
 Here's an example of a typical <<<changes.xml>>>, showing the syntax:

-------------------
<document>
  <properties>
    <title>Changes Tester Project</title>
    <author email="jruiz@exist.com">Johnny R. Ruiz III</author>
  </properties>
  <body>
    <release version="1.1" date="2005-03-01" description="Subsequent release">
      <action dev="jruiz" type="add">
        Added additional documentation on how to configure the plugin.
      </action>
      <action dev="aramirez" type="fix" issue="MPJIRA-11">
        Enable retrieving component-specific issues.
      </action>
      <action dev="jruiz" type="remove" due-to="Allan Ramirez" due-to-email="aramirez@exist.com">
        The element type " link " must be terminated by the matching end-tag.
        Deleted the erroneous code.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.0" date="2005-01-01" description="First release">
      <action dev="jruiz" type="update">
        Uploaded documentation on how to use the plugin.
      </action>
    </release>
  </body>
</document>
-------------------

 See the {{{changes.html}Changes Reference}} for details regarding the
 <<<\<release\>>>> and <<<\<action\>>>> elements and their attributes.

 To generate the Changes Report, insert the Changes Plugin in the
 <<<\<reporting\>>>> section of your project's <<<pom.xml>>>

-------------------
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
        <reportSets>
          <reportSet>
            <reports>
              <report>changes-report</report>
            </reports>
          </reportSet>
        </reportSets>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
-------------------

  and execute the site goal to generate the report.

-------------------
mvn site
-------------------

** Linking to Your Issue Management System

  If you use the <<<issue>>> attribute in your <<<changes.xml>>> file and have
  the <<<\<issueManagement\>>>> element configured in your <<<pom.xml>>>, the
  report will contain links to the issues in your issue management system. The
  default configuration produces links to JIRA, but that can be
  {{{changes-report-mojo.html}configured}}.

  <<Note:>> If you have
  another issue tracker, make sure that your <<<\<issueManagement\>/\<url\>>>> is
  correct. In particular, make sure that it has a trailing slash if it needs one.
  The plugin can't add this for you, because it needs to handle different issue
  management systems. If your issue management system is at
  <<<http://www.company.com/bugzilla/>>>
  the links will not work if you enter <<<http://www.company.com/bugzilla>>>
  in your <<<pom.xml>>>.


*How to Generate the JIRA Report

  <<Note:>> To use the JIRA Report, the <<<\<issueManagement\>>>> section in
  the <<<pom.xml>>> of your project must be configured. It might look something
  like this:

-------------------
<project>
  ...
  <issueManagement>
    <system>JIRA</system>
    <url>http://jira.codehaus.org/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10450</url>
  </issueManagement>
  ...
</project>
-------------------

  To generate the JIRA Report, insert the Changes Plugin in the
  <<<\<reporting\>>>> section of your project's <<<pom.xml>>>

-------------------
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
        <reportSets>
          <reportSet>
            <reports>
              <report>jira-report</report>
            </reports>
          </reportSet>
        </reportSets>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
-------------------

  and execute the site goal to generate the report.

-------------------
mvn site
-------------------

  For info on how to modify the JIRA Report see the
  {{{examples/customizing-jira-report.html}Customizing the JIRA Report}}
  example.


*How to generate and send the Announcement via Email

  As usual we start by configuring your project's <<<pom.xml>>>. We add a basic
  configuration for sending emails and specify the lucky recipients of the
  announcement emails.

  For info on how to change the sender of the email see the
  {{{examples/specifying-mail-sender.html}Specifying the mail sender}} example.

-------------------
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          ...
          <smtpHost>mail.yourhost.com</smtpHost>
          <smtpPort implementation="java.lang.Integer">25</smtpPort>
          <toAddresses>
            <toAddress implementation="java.lang.String">someones@email.com</toAddress>
            <toAddress implementation="java.lang.String">anothersomeone@email.com</toAddress>
          </toAddresses>
          ...
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
-------------------

  You can now generate the announcement by executing the command below:

-------------------
mvn changes:announcement-generate
-------------------

  If you want to generate the announcement based on JIRA you would either
  configure it in your <<<pom.xml>>> or you would add the appropriate parameter
  on the command line, like this:

-------------------
mvn changes:announcement-generate -DgenerateJiraAnnouncement=true
-------------------

  This is how you send an email with the generated announcement:

-------------------
mvn changes:announcement-mail
-------------------
