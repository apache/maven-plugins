     <question>What's the difference between the changes-maven-plugin at Mojo and this one?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
         This plugin started out at <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/">the Mojo project</a>.
         In March of 2006 the plugin was moved to Apache and the Maven sandbox.
         So it's the same plugin, but this one is newer.

     <question>I get a <code>org.xml.sax.SAXParseException</code>, when generating the JIRA Report. What can do about it?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
         If you have a lot of entities in the xml file returned from your JIRA
         installation, you might get an error like this one, when you run the
         JIRA Report:

         <source>
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Parser has reached the entity expansion limit "64,000" set by the Application.
         </source>

         If that happens you need to tell the xml parser to use a higher limit.
         This can be accomplished by adding a command line parameter. In the
         following example we have set it to double the original value:

         <source>
mvn -DentityExpansionLimit=128000 ...
         </source>
       </p>
       <p>
         Unfortunately we have not been able to set this in Java. If someone
         knows how to do this, then please reopen
         <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCHANGES-75">MCHANGES-75</a>,
         and tell us how. It would be nicer if this could be set using a
         parameter in the POM.
