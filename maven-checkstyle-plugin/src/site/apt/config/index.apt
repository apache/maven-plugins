Predefined Rulesets

  Maven Checkstyle Plugin contains this predefined ruleset:

   * {{{./sun_checks.html}<<<config/sun_checks.xml>>>}},

   []

  In versions up to and including 2.13 the plugin also included the
  <<<config/maven_checks.xml>>> predefined ruleset. In version 2.14 this was
  moved to {{{/shared/maven-shared-resources/}maven-shared-resources}}. It is
  still available to use, because maven-shared-resources has been added as a
  dependency to Maven Checkstyle Plugin

  In versions up to and including 2.13 the plugin also included the
  <<<config/avalon_checks.xml>>> predefined ruleset. This was removed in
  version 2.14.

  In versions up to and including 2.14 the plugin also included the
  <<<config/turbine_checks.xml>>> predefined ruleset. This was removed in
  version 2.15.
