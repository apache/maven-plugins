Upgrading Checkstyle at Runtime

   Maven Checkstyle plugin comes with a default Checkstyle version: for <<<maven-checkstyle-plugin ${project.version}>>>,
   Checkstyle  ${checkstyleVersion} is used by default.

   Given Checkstyle generally keeps good compatibility between versions, you can override the version used at runtime to
   benefit from {{{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/releasenotes.html}Checkstyle latest bugfixes}}:
