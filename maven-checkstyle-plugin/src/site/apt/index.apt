Maven 2 Checkstyle Plugin

  The Checkstyle plugin generates report regarding the code style used by the developers. For more information about Checkstyle,
  see {{{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/}http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/}}

  The plugin can be configured in the project's pom. Predefined rulesets are included with the plugin, these are:
  sun_checks.xml, turbine_checks.xml, avalon_checks.xml and maven_checks.xml. You can also use a custom ruleset by
  specifying it in the plugin configuration.

* Goals Overview

   The Checkstyle Plugin has two goals:

   * {{{checkstyle-mojo.html}checkstyle:checkstyle}} performs Checkstyle analysis and generates a report on violations.

   * {{{check-mojo.html}checkstyle:check}} performs a violation check against the last Checkstyle run to see if there are
     any violations. It reads the Checkstyle output file, counts the number of violations found and displays it on the
     console.

* Usage

   Instructions on how to use the Checkstyle Plugin can be found {{{usage.html}here}}.
