    <faq id="How are the Checkstyle properties set">
      <question>How are the Checkstyle properties set?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          You can set the Checkstyle properties to be used in the plugin configuration of your POM through the
          <code>propertiesLocation</code> parameter. The properties file will be resolved by the plugin based
          on its value.

    <faq id="How do I set a custom ruleset">
      <question>How do I set a custom ruleset?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          You can set a custom ruleset through the <code>configLocation</code> plugin parameter. If no value is
          specified, the plugin will use a default ruleset, which is the <code>sun_checks.xml</code>, that is bundled with the
          plugin.

     <faq id="What is the difference between checkstyle:checkstyle and checkstyle:check">
          <question>What is the difference between checkstyle:checkstyle and checkstyle:check?</question>
          <answer>
            <p>
              The checkstyle:checkstyle goal is a <strong>reporting</strong> goal that adds a report
              of Checkstyle violations to the output of the maven-site-plugin. The checkstyle:check goal
              is an ordinary goal that reports violations to the console and/or fails the build when there
              are violations.
