      <answer>
        <p>
          You can set the Checkstyle properties to be used in the plugin configuration of your pom through the
          <strong>propertiesLocation</strong> parameter. The properties file will be resolved by the plugin based
          on its value.

          You can set a custom ruleset through the <strong>configLocation</strong> plugin parameter. If no value is
          specified, the plugin will use a default ruleset, which is the <code>sun_checks.xml</code>, that is bundled with the
          plugin.
