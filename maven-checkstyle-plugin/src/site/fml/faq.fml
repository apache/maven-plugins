      <answer>
        <p>
        You can set the checkstyle properties to be used in the plugin configuration in your pom through the <strong>propertiesLocation</strong>
        parameter. The properties file will be resolved by the plugin based on its value.

      <question>How do I set a custom ruleset?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        You can set a custom ruleset through the <strong>configLocation</strong> plugin parameter. If no value is specified, the
        plugin will use a default ruleset, which is the sun_checks.xml, that is bundled with the plugin.
