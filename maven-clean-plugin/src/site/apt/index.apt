Overview

  The Clean Plugin is used when you want to remove files generated at
  build-time in a project's directory.

* Goals Overview

  The Clean Plugin only has one goal.

  * {{{clean-mojo.html}clean:clean}} attempts to clean a project's working
  directory of the files that we're generated at build-time.  By default, it
  discovers and deletes the directories configured in
  <<<project.build.directory>>>, <<<project.build.outputDirectory>>>,
  <<<project.build.testOutputDirectory>>>, and
  <<<project.reporting.outputDirectory>>>.

* Usage

  Instructions on the basic usage of the Clean Plugin can be found
  {{{usage.html}here}}.

* Examples

  To provide you with better understanding on some usages of the Clean Plugin,
  you can take a look into the following examples:

  * {{{examples/delete_additional_files.html}How to delete additional files outside of
  the default directories}}
