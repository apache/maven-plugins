/**
 * Instrument all sources using Clover and forks a custom lifecycle to execute project's tests on the instrumented code
 * so that a Clover database is created.
 *
 * Note: We're forking a lifecycle because we don't want the Clover instrumentation to affect the main lifecycle build.
 * This will prevent instrumented sources to be put in production by error. Thus running <code>mvn install</code> on
 * a project where this <code>instrument</code> goal has been specified will run the build twice: once for building the
 * project as usual and another time for instrumenting the sources with Clover and generating the Clover database.
