      <!-- This below is a HACK. It tries to prevent the build from stopping in
           case of build failures as we could still like to generate Clover
           reports even if it happens. The Clover plugin cannot know about all
           plugins that can execute and fail the build and moreover which can be
           bound to any phase by the user. A better solution would be for Maven
           to have a flag that says "continue the build even in case of
           failures". -->
