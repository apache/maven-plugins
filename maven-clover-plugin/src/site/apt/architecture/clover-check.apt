Architecture of the clover:check goal

  Here's how the <<<clover:check>>> goal works:

[../images/clover-check-achitecture.jpg] Clover check goal architecture

  Note that the generation of the Clover database is independent of the <<<clover:check>>> goal which expects
  a Clover database to exist prior to calling it. In the architecture diagram we've shown a typical use case
  where the creation of the Clover database is done by binding the <<<clover:instrument>>> goal to the
  <<<verify>>> phase, before the execution of the <<<clover:check>>> goal.
