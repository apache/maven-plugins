     <question>Why are my tests executed twice?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>The Clover plugin takes great care not to mix the instrumented code nor any artifact generated from it
       with main production sources and artifacts. This is the reason why you may see your tests executed twice: once
       for the production sources and once for the Clover-instrumented sources.
