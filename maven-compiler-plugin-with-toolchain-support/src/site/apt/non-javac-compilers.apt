Using Non-Javac Compilers

  Contrary to this plugin's name, the Compiler Plugin does not compile the
  sources of your project by itself. To compile, the Compiler Plugin uses
  another class to compile them. The parameter <<<compilerId>>> determines
  which class will be used. Currently, the Compiler Plugin is bundled with the
  <<<javac>>> compiler artifact with artifactId <<<plexus-compiler-javac>>>,
  which can be seen as one of the dependencies declared inside the Compiler
  Plugin's POM.

  Plexus have some other compiler Ids available under the groupId
  <<<org.codehaus.plexus>>>:

  * <<<aspectj>>> with artifactId <<<plexus-compiler-aspectj>>>.

  * <<<csharp>>> with artifactId <<<plexus-compiler-csharp>>>.

  * <<<eclipse>>> with artifactId <<<plexus-compiler-eclipse>>>.

  * <<<jikes>>> with artifactId <<<plexus-compiler-jikes>>>.


* Using The Other Plexus Compilers

  To use any of the non-javac compilers, you need to make the artifact available
  in the classpath when the Compiler Plugin runs. This is possible by adding the
  dependency when declaring the plugin in your project's pom.xml. The example
  below shows how to use the <<<csharp>>> compiler:

+-----
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    [...]
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <compilerId>csharp</compilerId>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.codehaus.plexus</groupId>
            <artifactId>plexus-compiler-csharp</artifactId>
            <version>1.5.2</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
  [...]
</project>
