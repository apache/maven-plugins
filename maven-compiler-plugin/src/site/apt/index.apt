Maven Compiler Plugin

  The Compiler Plugin is used to compile the sources of your project.  The
  default compiler is <<<javac>>> and is used to compile Java sources.  Other
  compilers can be used and work has already started on AspectJ, .NET, and C#.

  This Compiler Plugin is Maven 2 version of Maven 1.x's Java Plugin.

* Goals Overview

  The Compiler Plugin has two goals.  Both are already bound to their proper
  phases within the Maven Lifecycles and are therefore, automatically executed
  during their respective phases.

  * {{{compile-mojo.html}compiler:compile}} is bound to the compile phase and
  is used to compile the main source files.

  * {{{testCompile-mojo.html}compiler:testCompile}} is bound to the
  test-compile phase and is used to compile the test source files.

* How To Use

  Instructions on how to use the Compiler Plugin can be found
  {{{usage.html}here}}.
