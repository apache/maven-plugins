      <question>Is there a way to get Maven to report the number of compile errors found?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Currently, this type of summary information is not built into the compiler plugin, but it
          would be possible to add. If this feature is important to you, add your vote to
          <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-1854">MNG-1854</a>

    <faq id="how-to-add-generated-sources">
      <question>How do I add my generated sources to the compile path of Maven, when using modello?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>Modello generate the sources in the generate-sources phase and automatically adds the
          source directory for compilation in maven. So you don't have to copy the generated sources.
        </p>
        <p>You have to declare the modello-plugin in the build of your plugin for source generation
          (in that way the sources are generated each time).
        </p>
        <p>The Modello website can be found
          <a href="http://modello.codehaus.org/">here</a>
