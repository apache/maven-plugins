/**
 * Goal that collects the project dependencies from the repository.
 * This goal requires Maven 3.0 or higher to function because it uses "requiresDependencyCollection".
 * This means that it lists the groupId:artifactId:version information by downloading the pom files
 * without downloading the actual artifacts such as jar files.
 * This is very useful when full dependency resolution might fail due to projects which haven't been built yet.
 * <p/>
 * It is identical to {@link ResolveDependenciesMojo} except for using the requiresDependencyCollection annotation
 * attribute instead of requiresDependencyResolution.
