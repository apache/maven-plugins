     <question>What is the difference between dependency-maven-plugin and maven-dependency-plugin?</question>
     <answer>
        <p>
            Actually, they are the same, it's just that it was moved and renamed. The dependency-maven-plugin
            is hosted at Mojo while maven-dependency-plugin is hosted at Apache. The recommended
            plugin to use is the maven-dependency-plugin.
