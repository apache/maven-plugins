     <question>What is the difference between dependency-maven-plugin and maven-dependency-plugin?</question>
     <answer>
        <p>
            Actually, they are the same, it's just that it was moved and renamed. The dependency-maven-plugin
            is hosted at Mojo while maven-dependency-plugin is hosted at Apache. The recommended
            plugin to use is the maven-dependency-plugin.

     <question>When executing mvn dependency:unpack or dependency:copy from the command line, I get "One or more required plugin parameters are invalid/missing for 'dependency:unpack'"</question>
	 <answer>
	 	<p>
	 		In order for this to work, you must configure the ArtifactItems as shown <a href="examples/copying-artifacts.html#Copying From the Command Line">here</a>. Note that when executing a plugin from 
	 		the command line, you must put the configuration tag outside of the executions.
	 		
	 		If you haven't done this correctly, the error will look like this:
	 		<pre>
[0] inside the definition for plugin: 'maven-dependency-plugin'specify the following:
	 		</pre>

  <faq id="missing">
  <question>Why am I getting errors that a documented goal or parameter is missing?</question>
  <answer><p>The latest documents are published and may preceed the actual release. Check to make sure the goal/parameter is in the most recent version.
  	<b> -OR- </b>
  	Maven may be resolving the older codehaus version of the dependency plugin. See next question.</p>
  </answer>
  </faq>
    <faq id="question">
  <question>Why is Maven resolving "dependency:xxx" to the older org.codehaus.mojo:dependency-maven-plugin?</question>
  <answer><p>
  	Due to a bug in Maven in versions prior to 2.0.7 (<a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-2926">MNG-2926</a>) the search order was reversed and caused Mojo plugins to supercede ones with the same prefix at Apache.
  	The metadata at mojo was cleaned up when the maven-dependency-plugin was released at Apache. If you are still experiencing this error, chances are you have
  	old metadata in your local repository or in a proxy / internal repository. Removing /org/codehaus/mojo/maven-metadata.* from your repo/proxy will cause it to 
  	be refreshed. Alternatively, you can specify the groupId explicitely in your pom (if you are using a bound goal), or on the command line, use groupId:artifactId:version:mojo, ie mvn
org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:2.0-alpha-4:unpack
  	</p>
  </answer>
  </faq>
      <faq id="includes">
  <question>Why am I having trouble unpacking only a specific file?</question>
  <answer><p>
  	The excludes will override the includes declaration. That means if you specify excludes=**/* ,includes=**/foo, you will exclude everything. If you only want foo, then just specify the includes. The plexus component used to unpack uses the following code to determing which files to unpack: return isIncluded( name ) AND !isExcluded( name );
