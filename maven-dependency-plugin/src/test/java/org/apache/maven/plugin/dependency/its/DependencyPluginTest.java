/**
 * This class executes the IT tests. The setup will create a pom-test.xml from the plugin pom. The version is changed to
 * "test" and the tests themselves turned off to avoid an infinite loop. The test version of the plugin is then built
 * and installed to a new temporary local repo used to execute the tests. This only occurs once for the suite of tests.
 * Each test below just uses the tools to execute Maven on the named project with the passed in goals.
