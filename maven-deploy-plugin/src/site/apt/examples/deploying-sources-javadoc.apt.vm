Deploy sources and javadoc jars

  A project may include a main jar and associated sources and javadoc jars.

+---+
  artifact-name-1.0.jar
  artifact-name-1.0-sources.jar
  artifact-name-1.0-javadoc.jar
+---+

  The sources jar contains the Java sources, and the javadoc jar contains the generated javadocs.
  To include these files in your deployment, set the <<sources>> and <<javadoc>> parameters to 
  the paths to the sources and javadoc jar files.

mvn deploy:deploy-file -Durl=file:///home/me/m2-repo \
                       -DrepositoryId=some.repo.id \
                       -Dfile=./path/to/artifact-name-1.0.jar \
                       -DpomFile=./path/to/pom.xml \
