   <faq id="question">
     <question>I get an Unsupported Protocol Error when deploying a 3rd party jar. What should I do?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
         If you are using the <code>deploy:deploy-file</code> goal and encounter
         this error:
       </p>
       <p>
         <i>"Error deploying artifact: Unsupported Protocol: 'ftp': Cannot find
         wagon which supports the requested protocol: ftp"</i>
       </p>
       <p>
         Then you need to place the appropriate wagon provider in your
         <code>%M2_HOME%/lib</code>. In this case the provider needed is ftp,
         so we have to place the wagon-ftp jar in the lib directory of your
         Maven 2 installation.
       </p>
       <p>
         If the error description is something like this:
       </p>
       <p>
         <i>"Error deploying artifact: Unsupported Protocol: 'ftp': Cannot find
         wagon which supports the requested protocol: ftp
         org/apache/commons/net/ftp/FTP"</i>
       </p>
       <p>
         Then you need to place the commons-net jar in
         <code>%M2_HOME%/lib</code>.
       </p>

     <faq id="skip">
       <question>I don't want to deploy one of the artifacts in my multi-module build.  Can I skip deployment?</question>
       <answer>
         <p>
           Yes, you can skip deployment of individual modules by configuring the deploy plugin as follows:
         </p>
         <p>
           <pre>
             <plugin>
               <artifactId>maven-deploy-plugin</artifactId>
	           <version>X.Y</version>
	           <configuration>
                 <skip>true</skip>
               </configuration>
             </plugin>
           </pre>
         </p>
