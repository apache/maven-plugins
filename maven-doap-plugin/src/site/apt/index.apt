Introduction

  This plugin generates a Description of a Project (DOAP) file from a POM. We would like to be able to provide
  DOAP files for systems that use them as primary input but what to also alleviate the burden of maintaining
  two sets of metadata.

  Version 1.0 of this plugin is specifically tailored for use by projects at Apache, but this will change in
  subsequent versions as more people become interested in DOAP.
