      <question>What are the benefits of DOAP?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web">Semantic Web</a> provides
          mechanisms to process data provided in a form that is easily processed by machines. Thus,
          a DOAP is a machine readable document which facilitates projects research: it becomes much
          easier to seek information in the mass of data of the Web, since the data have a given
          foreseeable format.</p>

      <question>Why would I use DOAP when I have a POM?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>That's a very good question! The answer is that generating a DOAP file should take no
          effort if you are using Maven DOAP Plugin and it helps disseminate project information
          which can only be a good thing. Cataloging tools like <a href="http://swik.net/">SWiK</a>
          or like <a href="http://doapstore.org/">DoapStore</a> can benefit from you generating DOAP
          files and that can also only be a good thing. Even so, it is still important to spread as
          much information about projects around as possible so there is no downside to creating
          DOAP files.</p>
