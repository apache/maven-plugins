Usage

  This document is intended to provide instructions for using the
  Maven DOCCK Plugin. In order for this discussion to be useful, it's
  critical to cover two topics: Configuring your project's <<<pom.xml>>> to run
  the plugin during every build and using the plugin from the command-line.

* Configuring the plugin in <<<pom.xml>>>

   You can use the following configuration in your <<<pom.xml>>> to run the DOCCK
   Plugin everytime the project is built.

+---+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-docck-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>check</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+---+

* Using the plugin from the command-line

  The DOCCK Plugin is easily executed from the command line since it can run
  without any parameter configuration.

  To run the DOCCK Plugin on a project, type:

+---+
mvn docck:check
+---+

* Sample Output

** Run with no documentation errors
