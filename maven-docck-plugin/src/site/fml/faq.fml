   <faq id="question1">
     <question>Where did the standard came from?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
         The plugin documentation standard was created to address the frequent
         complaint of lack of documentation, specifically for the Maven plugins.
         The standard was based on suggestions made on the Maven dev mailing
         list with some refinements. It is a community consensus of what basic
         documentation a Maven plugin should have.

   <faq id="question2">
     <question>Why do we need a documentation standard?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>
         The standard is not a set of rules but a guide to help plugin
         developers document their plugins better, for the benefit of the users
         of the plugin. The standard also reminds the plugin developers of the
         important details that needs to be documented, to help speed up the
         adoption of the plugin.
