Customizing The File Name Mapping

  It might happen that your project has the same artifactId for different groups. To avoid file name
  clashing, specify the <<<full>>> file name mapping.

+--------
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-ear-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
           [...]
           <fileNameMapping>full</fileNameMapping>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
+---------

  As a result, each artifact file name will be prefixed by the groupId to avoid clashes. There is also a
  <<<no-version>>> file name mapping if you do not want to get the version in the file names.
