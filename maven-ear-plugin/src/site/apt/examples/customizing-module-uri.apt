Customizing A Module URI

  This is actually a combination of customizing the module's location and file
  name. The sample below shows how to specify the URI of a module being placed
  in the EAR file:

+--------
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-ear-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
           [...]
           <modules>
             <jarModule>
               <groupId>artifactGroupId</groupId>
               <artifactId>artifactId</artifactId>
               <uri>APP-INF/lib/anotherName-1.2.3.jar</uri>
             </jarModule>
          </modules>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
