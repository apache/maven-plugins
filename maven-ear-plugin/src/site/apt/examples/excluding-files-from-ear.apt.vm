Excluding Files From the EAR


  It is possible to exclude certain files from the EAR, by using the
  <<<\<packagingIncludes\>>>> and <<<\<packagingExcludes\>>>> configuration
  parameters. They each take a comma-separated list of Ant file set patterns.
  You can use wildcards such as <<<**>>> to indicate multiple directories and
  <<<*>>> to indicate an optional part of a file or directory name.


* Shared libraries

  One use case for this is if you want to use shared libraries in your
  application server. This involves configuring a location in your application
  server that contains some libraries that you want to share between several
  EARs. This is a bit like {{{./skinny-wars.html}skinny WARs}}, but taken to the
  next level. With skinny WARs you share libraries (JARs) between web
  applications within an enterprise application. Shared libraries as described
  here shares libraries (JARs) between enterprise applications.

  As an example, let's say that we want to exclude all non-in-house artifacts
  from the generated EARs, so that the EAR files we distribute only contains our
  own artifacts. The other dependencies we want to put in a shared library on
  our application server. They only serve to bloat our EAR files, especially
  if we're building or deploying several EARs, each with all of those
  dependencies in them.

  Our company in this example, the Acme Corporation, have wisely set a naming
  convention for all their in-house artifacts. The artifactId is always prefixed
  with "acme-". If they do not use a shared library, the directory layout for
  their applications might look like this:

+-----------------+
 acme-ear-1
 |-- acme-ejb-1.jar
 |-- acme-library-1.jar
 |-- acme-library-2.jar
 |-- acme-war-1.war
 |-- acme-war-2.war
 |-- external-library-1.jar
 |-- external-library-2.jar
 `-- external-library-3.jar

 acme-ear-2
 |-- acme-ejb-1.war
 |-- acme-library-1.jar
 |-- acme-library-2.jar
 |-- acme-war-3.war
 |-- acme-war-4.war
 |-- external-library-2.jar
 |-- external-library-3.jar
 `-- external-library-4.jar
+-----------------+


** Configuring the EARs

  In order for us to avoid having duplicate copies of the external libraries we
  need to do two things. First we make sure that our EARs only contain our own
  artifacts. We do this with the <<<\<packagingIncludes\>>>> parameter, which
  tells the EAR Plugin what files to include in the EAR. Everything else will be
  excluded. This configuration should be used in all of Acme's EAR projects, so
  it would be better to move this configuration to a parent that is shared
  by all of Acme's EAR projects.

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-ear-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <packagingIncludes>META-INF/**,**/acme-*.jar,**/acme-*.war</packagingIncludes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+


** Creating the shared library EAR

  Next we create a shared library EAR that contains all the dependencies that we
  want to share between the EARs. In this example we are packaging our shared
  library as an EAR. What type of packaging you can use differ between various
  application servers.

  <<Note:>> The <<<\<version\>>>> elements of the dependencies have been omitted
  here for brevity.

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <artifactId>external-shared-libraries</artifactId>
  <packaging>ear</packaging>
  ...
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.external.supplier</groupId>
      <artifactId>external-library-1.jar</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.external.supplier</groupId>
      <artifactId>external-library-2.jar</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.external.supplier</groupId>
      <artifactId>external-library-3.jar</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.external.supplier</groupId>
      <artifactId>external-library-4.jar</artifactId>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-ear-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+

** The results

  With all the Maven configuration done, the resulting directory layout would
  look like this:

+-----------------+
 external-shared-libraries
 |-- external-library-1.jar
 |-- external-library-2.jar
 |-- external-library-3.jar
 `-- external-library-4.jar

 acme-ear-1
 |-- acme-ejb-1.jar
 |-- acme-library-1.jar
 |-- acme-library-2.jar
 |-- acme-war-1.war
 `-- acme-war-2.war

 acme-ear-2
 |-- acme-ejb-1.war
 |-- acme-library-1.jar
 |-- acme-library-2.jar
 |-- acme-war-3.war
 `-- acme-war-4.war
+-----------------+

  <<Note:>> You would also need to configure your application server to use
  <<<external-shared-libraries>>> as a shared library. How you do that is
  however out of scope for this example.
