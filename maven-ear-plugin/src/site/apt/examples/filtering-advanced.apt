Filtering: Advanced techniques

  The following features are described in this document:

  * Escaping properties that should not be filtered

  * Ignoring files based on its extension


* Escaping properties

  It may be necessary to filters some properties in a file and ignore another. The
  filtering mechanism won't touch a token that is not recognized (i.e. that
  represents an unknown property). This won't work if the property is known
  obviously so it should be escaped explicitely.

  The following configuration defines the value of the <<<escapeString>>> which will
  stop the interpolation of a property if it starts with that value

+--------
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-ear-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
           <filtering>true</filtering>
           <escapeString>\</escapeString>
           [...]
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
+---------

  Assuming the following file

+--------
jdbc.url=${db.url}
jdbc.user=${db.username}
jdbc.password=\${db.password}
+--------

  Filtering the content of such a file with this config will produce this content.
  Note that that the escaped property can now be filtered the usual way later if
  necessary!

+--------
jdbc.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl
jdbc.user=someuser
jdbc.password=${db.password}
+--------


* Ignoring files based on its extension

  Filtering binary files corrupt them so it may be necessary to exclude files from
  filtering based on the extension. To do so, configure the plugin as follow

+--------
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-ear-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
           <filtering>true</filtering>
           <nonFilteredFileExtensions>
             <nonFilteredFileExtension>png</nonFilteredFileExtension>
             <nonFilteredFileExtension>jpeg</nonFilteredFileExtension>
           </nonFilteredFileExtensions>
           [...]
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
