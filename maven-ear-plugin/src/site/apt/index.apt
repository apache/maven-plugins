Maven EAR Plugin

  This plugin generates J2EE Enterprise Archive (EAR) file. It can also generate
  the deployment descriptor file (e.g. application.xml).

  The EAR plugin supports the following artifacts:

  * ejb

  * war

  * jar

  * ejb-client

  * rar

  * ejb3

  * par

  * sar

  * wsr

  * har

  []

  For available configuration options for these artifacts, please see the
  {{{modules.html}modules configuration}}.

  For more information about the J2EE technology, please visit
  {{http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2EE/Intro}}.

* Goals Overview

  EAR Plugin has two goals:

  * {{{ear-mojo.html}ear:ear}} generates J2EE Enterprise Archive (EAR) files.

  * {{{generate-application-xml-mojo.html}ear:generate-application-xml}}
  generates the deployment descriptor file(s).

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the EAR Plugin can be found on the {{{usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Further real-life examples are given in the plugin's
  {{{tests.html}test suite}}. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute additional examples, tips or errata to
  the {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/EAR+Plugin}plugin's wiki page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
