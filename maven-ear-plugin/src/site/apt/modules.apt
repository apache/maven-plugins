EAR Modules

  The EAR Plugin supports additional configurations of the following modules:

  * {{{#ejb3Module}ejb3Module}}

  * {{{#ejbClientModule}ejbClientModule}}

  * {{{#ejbModule}ejbModule}}

  * {{{#javaModule}javaModule}}

  * {{{#parModule}parModule}}

  * {{{#rarModule}rarModule}}

  * {{{#sarModule}sarModule}}

  * {{{#webModule}webModule}}

  * {{{#wsrModule}wsrModule}}

  * {{{#harModule}harModule}}

  []

  If the artifact you want to configure is not listed above, you can create your
  own custom artifact configuration by following the
  {{{#Custom Artifact Types}adding custom artifact types}} guide below this page.

  These module names go into the <<<modules>>> parameter of the EAR Plugin. For
  example, to configure the properties of an EjbModule, the EAR Plugin
  configuration for <<<modules>>> would look like:

+-----
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    [...]
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-ear-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <modules>
            <ejbModule>
              <!-- property configurations goes here -->
            </ejbModule>
          </modules>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      [...]
</project>

  add the following to the pom's configuration:

+--------
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-ear-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <artifactTypeMappings>
            <artifactTypeMapping type="my-rar" mapping="rar"/>
          </artifactTypeMappings>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
