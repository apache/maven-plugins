EAR Plugin Tests

  This page lists the EAR Plugin integration tests. Each tests is built on top of a sample project available in
  the {{{http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/plugins/trunk/maven-ear-plugin/src/test/resources/projects/}svn repository}}.
  This structure provides lots of concrete use cases for beginners.
