Ear Plugin Tests

  This page lists the ear plugin integration tests. Each tests is built on top of a sample project available in
  the {{{http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/plugins/trunk/maven-ear-plugin/src/test/resources/projects/}svn repository}}.
  This structure provides lots of concrete use cases for beginners.

  * project-001: builds an EAR with a single EJB and no configuration.

  * project-002: builds an EAR with a customized artifact location and a customized artifact name

  * project-003: builds an EAR with a defalt bundle directory for _java_ modules

  * project-004: builds an EAR with a defalt bundle directory for _java_ modules and a custom location overriding the default

  * project-005: builds an EAR with a custom URI

  * project-006: builds an EAR with an excluded module

  * project-007: builds an EAR with a classified artifact and no extra configuration

  * project-008: builds an EAR with deployment descriptor configuration for J2EE 1.3

  * project-009: builds an EAR with deployment descriptor configuration for J2EE 1.4

  * project-010: builds an EAR with deployment descriptor configuration for Java EE 5

  * project-011: builds an EAR and make sure that deployment descriptor default settings are applied

  * project-012: builds an EAR and make sure that EAR resources are bundled within the EAR

  * project-013: builds an EAR and make sure that EAR resources in a customized resources directory are bundled within the EAR

  * project-014: builds an EAR and make sure that EAR resources are bundled within the EAR using includes and excludes

  * project-015: builds an EAR and make sure that default manifest is taken into account

  * project-016: builds an EAR and make sure that custom manifest is taken into account

  * project-017: builds an EAR and make sure that custom application.xml is taken into account

  * project-018: builds an EAR with a custom final name

  * project-019: builds an EAR with unpacked archives using the unpackTypes.

  * project-020: builds an EAR with unpacked archives using the unpack module attribute

  * project-021: builds an EAR with unpacked archives using both unpackTypes and the unpack module attribute

  * project-022: builds an EAR with a classifier

  * project-023: builds an EAR and make sure that a single classified dependency is detected without specifying the classifier

  * project-024: builds an EAR and make sure that a single classified dependency is detected when specifying the classifier

  * project-025: builds an EAR and make sure that a classified dependency with mutiple candidates is detected when specifying the classifier

  * project-026: builds an EAR and make sure that the build fails if a unclassifed module configuration with mutiple candidates is specified

  * project-027: builds an EAR and make sure that provided dependencies are not included in the EAR

  * project-028: builds an EAR and make sure that test dependencies are not included in the EAR

  * project-029: builds an EAR and make sure that system dependencies are not included in the EAR

  * project-030: builds an EAR and make sure that ejb-client dependencies are detected and added in the generated application.xml
