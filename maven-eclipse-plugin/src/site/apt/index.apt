Maven Eclipse Plugin

  The Eclipse Plugin is used to generate Eclipse IDE files (*.classpath,
  *.wtpmodules and the .settings folder) for use with a project.

* Goals Overview

  The Maven Eclipse Plugin has five goals:

  * {{{add-maven-repo-mojo.html}eclipse:add-maven-repo}} is used to add the
  classpath variable MAVEN_REPO to Eclipse which points to your local
  repository.

  * {{{clean-mojo.html}eclipse:clean}} is used to delete the files used by the
  Eclipse IDE.

  * {{{eclipse-mojo.html}eclipse:eclipse}} generates the Eclipse configuration
  files.
  
  * {{{make-artifacts-mojo.html}eclipse:make-artifacts}} copies all Eclipse plugins from an 
  installation directory to the local repository, generating POMs for each.
  
  * {{{install-plugins-mojo.html}eclipse:install-plugins}} installs all resolved project 
  dependencies of a particular type (usually 'eclipse-plugin') into the specified Eclipse
  installation directory.

* Usage

  Instructions on how to use the Eclipse Plugin can be found {{{usage.html}here}}.
