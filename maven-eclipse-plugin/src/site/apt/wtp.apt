WTP support

 The Eclipse plugin supports creating configurations for Eclipse WTP (Web Tools
 Project). Projects with a WAR packaging can be setup as WTP dynamic web
 projects and runtime dependencies are configured to be used when running them
 using Eclipse internal servers.



* WTP versions
 
 In order to create a configuration for WTP you have to specify the version of
 WTP you are using.
 
 The plugin actually can create WTP R7, 1.0 and 1.5 configuration files.
 
 Note that R7/1.0 configuration files are totally different, so be sure to
 check the version you are using. WTP 1.5 configuration is slightly changed
 from 1.0 and WTP 1.5 can also use WTP 1.0 config files without problems.

 In order to generate WTP configuration files simply run:
 
+-----------------------------------------------------+
mvn -Dwtpversion=R7 eclipse:eclipse
+-----------------------------------------------------+
 
 Where wtpversion can be <<<R7>>>, <<<1.0>>>, <<<1.5>>> or <<<none>>> (default).
 
 <Note that in the 2.0 version of the plugin the default was R7 and WTP
 configuration was always generated. Now that different incompatible versions
 are out the default is to not to generate WTP configuration if the user
 doesn't specify the desired version.>

 
* WTP 1.0 warning

 Unfortunately WTP 1.0 has been shipped with a bug which prevents external
 dependencies from working.
 
 <<This means that only project-dependencies (in a multi-module build) will
 work, but any other dependency in the POM will be ignored when running the web
 application inside Eclipse.>>
 
 This bug has been fixed in release 1.0.1, so if you are still using WTP 1.0 be
 sure to update it to the 1.0.1 (or newer) release.
