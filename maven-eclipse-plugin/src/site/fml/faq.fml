   <faq id="import-javadoc">
     <question>Can I make the eclipse plugin to download and attach javadocs to my libraries?</question>
     <answer>
       <p>Quoting what Fabrizio said in the mailing list...</p>
       <i>
       <p>"The current revision in svn of the eclipse plugin (which is expected
       to be released as soon as an usable wtp 1.0.1 build will be out) has
       support for javadoc attachments, as an alternative to source jars."</p>

       <p>"When using the downloadSources flag if a source jar is not found the
       plugin will look for a javadoc jar. This is expecially useful for non
       open source projects and when used with eclipse 3.2 (in eclipse 3.2 M4
       javadoc view and editor tooltips also work with javadoc archives)."</p>

       <p>"I didn't find useful to have both sources and javadocs attached, since
       javadocs are automatically extracted by eclipse: if you think this
       should be needed please post an enhancement request in Jira with the
       reasons... "</p>
