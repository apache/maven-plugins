Using the ejb-client as a dependency

 The EJB Plugin is capable of generating another artifact aside from the primary one which is EJB. To choose the EJB client
 as the dependency just specify the type as <<<ejb-client>>>. 

* Normal way of adding an EJB dependency
 
 The following dependency declaration would include the primary EJB artifact <<<ejb-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar>>> in your
 project's package.
 
+------------+   
<project>
  [...]
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.example</groupId>
      <artifactId>ejb-project</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <type>ejb</type>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  [...]
</project>
+------------+
   
* Using the ejb-client

 Using the following dependency declaration would instead use the ejb-client artifact
 <<<ejb-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT-client.jar>>> in your project's package.

+------------+   
<project>
  [...]
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.example</groupId>
      <artifactId>ejb-project</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <type>ejb-client</type>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  [...]
</project>
+------------+
