Usage

 The EJB Plugin is used to package an EJB module. There are two ways to use the EJB Plugin:

 * If the packaging type defined in the <<<pom.xml>>> is <<<ejb>>>, the <<<package>>> lifecycle phase can be used

+--------------+
  mvn package
+--------------+

 * or using the <<<ejb:ejb>>> goal

+--------------+
  mvn ejb:ejb
+--------------+

 []

 The plugin doesn't do any EJB specific processing during the generation of the jar except for validating the existence
 of an EJB deployment descriptor if the EJB version is 2.0+, but it provides the following customization:

  * The EJB version to use

  * {{{./examples/generating-ejb-client.html}Generating and customizing an ejb-client}}

 <<Note:>> The dependencies will not be package with the EJB jar.

* Specifying the EJB version to use

  In EJB3, the <<<ejb-jar.xml>>> deployment descriptor is not mandatory anymore. By default
  the plugin assumes version 2.1. To use another version, configure the plugin as follows:

+--------
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-ejb-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <ejbVersion>3.0</ejbVersion>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
