Version Range Specification   

   The {{{requireMavenVersion.html}RequireMavenVersion}} and {{{requireJavaVersion.html}RequireJavaVersion}} rules use the {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Dependency+Mediation+and+Conflict+Resolution#DependencyMediationandConflictResolution-DependencyVersionRanges}standard Maven version range syntax}} with one minor change for ease of use (denoted with *):
   

*----------*--------------+
| Range    | Meaning      |
*----------*--------------+
| 1.0      | x \>\= 1.0 \* The default Maven meaning for 1.0 is everything (,) but with 1.0 recommended. Obviously this doesn't work for enforcing versions here, so it has been redefined as a minimum version.
  |
*----------*--------------+
| (,1.0]   | x \<\= 1.0     |
*----------*--------------+
| (,1.0)   | x \< 1.0      |
