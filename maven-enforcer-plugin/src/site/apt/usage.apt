  Brief examples on how to use the enforcer goals.
 
* Generic Plugin configuration information

  See the following links for information about including and configuring plugins in your project:
  
  *{{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-configuring-plugins.html}Configuring Plugins}}
  
  *{{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/plugin/guide-java-plugin-development.html}Plugin Development}}

  *{{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-plugin-prefix-mapping.html}Plugin Prefix}}
  
  []

* The <<<enforcer:enforce>>> and <<<enforcer:enforce-once>>> mojos

   These goals are meant to be bound to a lifecycle phase and configured in your
   <<<pom.xml>>>. The enforcers execute the configured rules to check for certain constraints. 
   The available standard rules are described {{{rules/index.html}here}}. Besides the rules to execute, these goals support three options:
   
   * {{{enforce-mojo.html#skip}skip}} - a quick way to skip checks via a profile or using -Denforcer.skip=true from the command line.
   
   * {{{enforce-mojo.html#fail}fail}} - if the goal should fail the build when a rule fails. The default is true. If false, the errors will be logged as warnings.
   
   * {{{enforce-mojo.html#failFast}failFast}} - if the goal should stop checking after the first failure. The default is false.
   
   []
   
   Each rule to be executed should be added to the rules element along with the specific configuration for that rule.
   
   The <<<enforce>>> goal executes against each project in a multi-project build. The <<<enforce-once>>> goal executes
   just once per build. This is most effective for the standard rules because the Maven, Java and OS versions will not change between projects in the same build.
   
   
   Sample Plugin Configuration:
   
+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
   <plugins>
     <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>enforce-versions</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>enforce</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <rules>
                <requireMavenVersion>
                  <version>2.0.6</version>
                </requireMavenVersion>
                <requireJavaVersion>
                  <version>1.5</version>
                </requireJavaVersion>
                <requireOS>
                  <family>unix</family>
                </requireOS>		
              </rules>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+---+
  
* The <<<enforcer:display-info>>> mojo

   This goal is used to determine the current information as detected by the standard rules:
     
+---+
   mvn enforcer:display-info
   ...
   [enforcer:display-info]
       Maven Version: 2.0.6
       JDK Version: 1.5.0_11 normalized as: 1.5.0-11
       OS Info: Arch: x86 Family: windows Name: windows xp Version: 5.1
