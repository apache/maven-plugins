Deploy Signed Artifacts

  Without this plugin you would deploy your project like this:

+----------+
mvn deploy
+----------+

 If you have configured this plugin according to the instructions in the
 {{{../usage.html}usage page}} then you just need to specify the passphrase for
 your private key on the command line. Like this:

+----------+
mvn deploy -Dgpg.passphrase=thephrase
+----------+

  If you don't specify a passphrase, it will prompt for one.



Issue with invalid signatures on the pom files
  
  Maven 2.0.5 fixes a problem where the pom files would end up changing between 
  signing them and deploying them.   If the signatures on the pom files are invalid, 
  make sure you upgrade to Maven 2.0.5.


Install/Deploy without configuring the plugin in the pom
 
  Currently this is not easily accomplished.   gpg signs the artifacts attached to the
  build at the point that gpg runs.   However, we want to "inject" the gpg into the phases.
  What MIGHT work is:

+----------+
mvn verify gpg:sign install:install deploy:deploy
+----------+

  However, if there are other plugins configured for phases after the verify phase, they will not be run.
