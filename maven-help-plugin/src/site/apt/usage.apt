Usage

 Below are the different goals and configuration of the Help plugin.

* The <<<help:active-profiles>>> Mojo

  The <<<active-profiles>>> mojo is used to discover which profiles have been applied to the projects currently being built.
  For each project in the build session, it will output a list of profiles which have been applied to that project, along
  with the source of the profile (POM, settings.xml, or profiles.xml).

  Optionally, the output parameter can be specified to divert this output to a file.

  You can execute this mojo using the following command:

+-----+
mvn help:active-profiles -Doutput=/path/to/file
+-----+

* The <<<help:describe>>> Mojo

  The <<<describe>>> mojo is used to discover information about Maven plugins. Given a plugin prefix or groupId, artifactId,
  and optionally version, the mojo will lookup that plugin and output details about it. If the user also specifies
  which mojo to describe, the <<describe>> mojo will limit output to the details of that mojo, including parameters.

  Optionally, the output parameter can be specified to divert this output to a file.

  This mojo requires either the groupId and artifactId parameters or the plugin parameter to be specified:

+-----+
mvn help:describe -DgroupId=org.somewhere
    -DartifactId=some-plugin -Dversion=0.0.0
+-----+

 or

+-----+
mvn help:active-profiles -Dplugin=org.somewhere:some-plugin:0.0.0
+-----+

 (NOTE: version is always optional here.)

* The <<<help:effective-pom>>> Mojo

  The <<<effective-pom>>> mojo is used to make visible the POM that results from the application of interpolation, inheritance,
  and active profiles. It provides a useful way of removing the guesswork about just what ends up in the POM that Maven uses
  to build your project. It will iterate over all projects in the current build session, printing the effective POM for each.

  Optionally, the output parameter can be specified to divert this output to a file.

  The mojo can be executedd using the following command:

+-----+
mvn help:effective-profiles -Doutput=/path/to/file
+-----+

* The <<<help:effective-settings>>> Mojo

  The <<<effective-settings>>> mojo is used to view the Settings that Maven actually uses to run the build. This Settings
  instance is a result of merging the global file with the user's file, with the user's file taking precedence.

  Optionally, the output parameter can be specified to divert this output to a file.

  The mojo can be executedd using the following command:

+-----+
mvn help:effective-settings -Doutput=/path/to/file
+-----+
