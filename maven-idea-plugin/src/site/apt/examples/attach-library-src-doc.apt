Attach Sources and/or Javadocs to Library Dependencies

  Artifacts with sources and javadocs deployed can be attached to IDEA libraries
  using <<<downloadSources>>> and <<<downloadJavadocs>>> respectively. The
  following example shows how to do this in the command-line:

+-----
mvn idea:idea -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true
+-----

  or if you prefer putting the configuration in your pom.xml:

+-----
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    [...]
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-idea-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <downloadSources>true</downloadSources>
          <downloadJavadocs>true</downloadJavadocs>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      [...]
    </plugins>
    [...]
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
