Enable Assertions and other JVM 5.0 features supported by IDEA

  IntelliJ IDEA supports JVM 5.0 and its new features. These are not enabled by
  default if the JVM running is less than 1.5. To enable them, you can use the
  following command:

+-----
mvn idea:idea -DjdkLevel=1.5
+-----

  or in your pom.xml:

+-----
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    [...]
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-idea-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <jdkLevel>1.5</jdkLevel>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      [...]
    </plugins>
    [...]
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
