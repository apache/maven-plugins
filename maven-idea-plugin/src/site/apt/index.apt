  The IDEA Plugin is used to generate files (ipr, iml, and iws) for a project
  so you can work on it using the IDE, IntelliJ IDEA.

* Goals Overview

  The IDEA Plugin has five goals.

  * {{{idea-mojo.html}idea:idea}} is used to execute the other three goals of
  this plugin: <<<project>>>, <<<module>>>, and <<<workspace>>>.

  * {{{project-mojo.html}idea:project}} is used to generate the project file
  (*.ipr) needed for an IntelliJ IDEA Project.

  * {{{module-mojo.html}idea:module}} is used to generate the module files
  (*.iml) needed for an IntelliJ IDEA Module.

  * {{{workspace-mojo.html}idea:workspace}} is used to generate the workspace
  file (*.iws) needed for an IntelliJ IDEA Project.

  * {{{clean-mojo.html}idea:clean}} is used to delete the files relevant to
  IntelliJ IDEA.
