Maven IDEA Plugin: Usage

* Generating the IntelliJ IDEA project files

  To generate the files needed for an IntelliJ IDEA Project setup, you need
  only to execute the main plugin goal, which is <<<idea:idea>>> like so:

+-----
mvn idea:idea
+-----

  The above command will execute the other three goals needed to setup your
  project for IntelliJ IDEA: <<<idea:project>>>, <<<idea:module>>>, and
  <<<idea:workspace>>>.

  Please note that this plugin has no way to determine the name of the jdk
  library you are using.  By default, this uses the jdk name equivalent to
  <<<java -version>>> in your machine.  If you know the name of the jdk library
  to use, for example, 1.5, you can then execute:

+-----
mvn idea:idea -DjdkName=1.5
+-----

* Deleting IDEA project files

  To delete the project files used by IntelliJ IDEA, you can execute the
  command below:

+-----
mvn idea:clean
+-----

* Creating the IDEA project files separately

  If, for some reason, you want to create just one of the <<<ipr>>>,
  <<<iml>>>, or <<<iws>>> files, you can still do it.

  To generate just the <<<ipr>>> file, use:

+-----
mvn idea:project
+-----

  To generate just the <<<iml>>> files, use:

+-----
mvn idea:module
+-----

  To generate just the <<<iws>>> file, use:

+-----
mvn idea:workspace
+-----
