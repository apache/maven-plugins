Generating a generic POM

  There are times when you do not have a POM for a 3rd party artifact.
  For instance, when installing a proprietary or commercial JAR into a repository.
  The Install Plugin can create a generic POM in this case which
  contains the minimal set of POM elements required by Maven, such as groupId,
  artifactId, version, packaging.  You tell Maven to generate a POM by setting the
  <<<generatePom>>> parameter to <<<true>>>.

+---+
mvn ${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:${project.version}:install-file  -Dfile=path-to-your-artifact-jar \
                                                                              -DgroupId=your.groupId \
                                                                              -DartifactId=your-artifactId \
                                                                              -Dversion=version \
                                                                              -Dpackaging=jar \
                                                                              -DgeneratePom=true

  <<Note>>: By using the fully qualified path of a goal, you're ensured to be using the preferred version of the maven-install-plugin. When using <<<mvn install:install-file>>> 
  its version depends on its specification in the pom or the version of Apache Maven.
