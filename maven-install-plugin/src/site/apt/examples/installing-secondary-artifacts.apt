Installing Secondary Artifacts

  Sometimes you need to install secondary artifacts after the main artifact has
  been installed in your local repository. To install a secondary artifact you
  need to use the <<<classifier>>> parameter to classify the secondary artifact.

  Let us assume that you want to install the sources for an old artifact, like
  commons-logging-1.0.3. The
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/commons-logging/commons-logging/1.0.3/}central repository}}
  only has the main artifact and a <<<-javadoc>>> artifact for that version.
  Package up the sources into a JAR file on your local disk and then run the
  following command:

+---+
mvn install:install-file  -Dfile=path-to-commons-logging-sources.jar \
                          -DgroupId=commons-logging \
                          -DartifactId=commons-logging \
                          -Dversion=1.0.3 \
                          -Dpackaging=jar \
                          -Dclassifier=sources
+---+
