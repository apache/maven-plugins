Updating the release information of a project

  Updating the release information means that a forced update of the project's
  metadata takes place which sets the artifact as the release version.
  It is most useful when installing a plugin built from source so it can be
  used by other projects without explicitly asking for the latest SNAPSHOT
  version.

  This can be activated by setting the <<<updateReleaseInfo>>> parameter to <<<true>>>
  when installing.

  mvn install -DupdateReleaseInfo=true
