${project.name}

  The Install Plugin is used during the <<<install>>> phase to add
  artifact(s) to the local repository. The Install Plugin uses
  the information in the POM (groupId, artifactId, version) to determine
  the proper location for the artifact within the local repository.

  The local repository is the local cache where
  all artifacts needed for the build are stored. By default, it is located within
  the user's home directory <<<(~/.m2/repository)>>> but the location can be configured in
  <<<~/.m2/settings.xml>>> using the <<<\<localRepository\>>>> element.

* Goals Overview

  The Install Plugin has 3 goals:

  * {{{./install-mojo.html}install:install}} is used to automatically install the
    project's main artifact (the JAR, WAR or EAR), its POM and any attached artifacts
    (sources, javadoc, etc) produced by a particular project.

  * {{{./install-file-mojo.html}install:install-file}} is mostly used to install an externally
    created artifact into the local repository, along with its POM. In that case
    the project information can be taken from an optionally specified pomFile, but can
    also be given using command line parameters.

  * {{{./help-mojo.html}install:help}} displays help information on maven-install-plugin.

  []

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Install Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the
  {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Install+Plugin}plugin's wiki page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
