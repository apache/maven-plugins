Usage

* The <<<install:install>>> goal

  In most cases, <<<install:install>>> goal doesn't need any configuration, it
  needs the project's POM and the artifact file to be installed during the
  <<<install>>> phase of the default build lifecycle.

+---+
mvn install
+---+

* The <<<install:install-file>>> goal

  The <<<install:install-file>>> goal is used primarily for installing artifacts to
  the local repository which were not built by Maven. The project's development team
  may or may not provide a POM for the artifact. Here's a list of some of the available parameters for the
  <<<install-file>>> goal:

+---+
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=your-artifact-1.0.jar \
                         [-DpomFile=your-pom.xml] \
                         [-Dsources=src.jar] \
                         [-Djavadoc=apidocs.jar] \
                         [-DgroupId=org.some.group] \
                         [-DartifactId=your-artifact] \
                         [-Dversion=1.0] \
                         [-Dpackaging=jar] \
                         [-Dclassifier=sources] \
                         [-DgeneratePom=true] \
                         [-DcreateChecksum=true]
+---+

  * the groupId, artifactId, version and packaging of the file to install. These can
    be taken from the specified pomFile, and overridden or specified using the
    command line. When the pomFile contains a <parent> section, the parent's
    groupId can be considered if the groupId is not specified further for the
    current project or on the command line.

  * the optional <<<classifier>>> parameter can be used to
    {{{examples/installing-secondary-artifacts.html}install secondary artifacts}} for a project,
    like a <<<javadoc>>> or <<<sources>>> JAR.  If a classifier is not given, Maven assumes the file is the main
    artifact for the project.
