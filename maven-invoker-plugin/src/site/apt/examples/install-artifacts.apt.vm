Installing Artifacts

  The following example shows a plugin configuration using the <<<{{{../install-mojo.html}invoker:install}}>>> 
  goal.  This will cause the project artifact(s) to be installed to a dedicated local 
  repository before executing the projects.  This can be helpful if you 
  want to build your project and test the new artifacts artifact in a single step instead of 
  installing first and then running tests.
