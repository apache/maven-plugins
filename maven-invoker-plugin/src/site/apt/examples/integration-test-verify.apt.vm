Using with other integration test frameworks

  If you are using other integration test frameworks, or if you need to setup an integration test enviroment prior to
  test execution and tear that envronment down afterwards, then you need to use the <<<invoker:integration-test>>> and
  <<<invoker:verify>>> goals in place of <<<invoker:run>>>.  For example:

+----
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-invoker-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>integration-test</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>integration-test</goal>
              <goal>verify</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
+----

  This will allow any plugins bound to the <<<post-integration-test>>> phase to execute before the <<<verify>>> phase
  executes the <<<invoker:verify>>> goal that we have just bound.
