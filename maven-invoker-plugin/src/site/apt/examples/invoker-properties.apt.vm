Invoker Properties
 
  The various parameters in the plugin configuration provide a means to globally configure the goals, profiles etc.
  used to run a Maven build on the projects. However, for certain projects you might want to specify different settings.
  To avoid the hassle of multiple plugin executions, you can simply use a file named <<<invoker.properties>>> to
  control the build settings on a per project basis. The exact name of this properties file is configurable but it needs
  to reside in the base directory of the respective project as shown below:

+------------------
./
+- src/
   +- it/
      +- test-project/
         +- pom.xml
         +- invoker.properties
         +- src/
+------------------

  There are only a few keys supported in this file and their names typically match the corresponding parameters in the
  plugin configuration. For a complete overview of supported properties, see the example given in the documentation of
  the plugin parameter <<<{{{../run-mojo.html#invokerPropertiesFile}invokerPropertiesFile}}>>>.

  The comments given in the example should be rather self-explanatory. Looking closely, you can also notice that the
  syntax <<<$\{expression\}>>> can be used to filter the property values. What deserves some more description is the
  possibility to perform several Maven builds on the same project. By default, the Invoker Plugin will perform the
  following steps for each project:

  * Run the pre build hook script if existent

  * Invoke Maven in the project directory

  * Run the post build hook script if existent

  []

  Since plugin version 1.3, you can append a one-based index to the invoker properties in order to enable/configure
  further invocations of Maven. More precisely, <<<invoker.goals.1>>> specifies the goals for the first build,
  <<<invoker.goals.2>>> lists the goals for the second build and so on. These builds will be performed one after the
  other:

  * Run the pre build hook script if existent

  * Invoke Maven in the project directory

  * Invoke Maven in the project directory

  * ...

  * Invoke Maven in the project directory

  * Run the post build hook script if existent

  []

  Most of the properties can be indexed this way, e.g. <<<invoker.profiles.3>>> would specify the profiles to use for
  the third invocation. If the property <<<invoker.profiles.3>>> was not defined, the plugin would query the property
  <<<invoker.profiles>>> as a fallback to determine the profiles for the third build. This build loop ends after
  invocation <i> if no property <<<invoker.*.>>><i+1> is defined.

  The invoker properties can also be used to skip projects based on the current JRE version or OS family. For more
  information on this feature, please see {{{./selector-conditions.html}Selector Conditions}}.
