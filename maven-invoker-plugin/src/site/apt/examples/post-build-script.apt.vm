Using a Post-Build Script
 
  Here is an example of how the Invoker Plugin can be used to run a set of Maven projects and then verify their output
  with a {{{http://www.beanshell.org/}BeanShell}} or {{{http://groovy.codehaus.org/}Groovy}} script. The name of the
  script file in this case is <<<verify.bsh>>>.

-------------------
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-invoker-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <debug>true</debug>
          <projectsDirectory>src/it</projectsDirectory>
          <preBuildHookScript>setup.bsh</preBuildHookScript>
          <postBuildHookScript>verify.bsh</postBuildHookScript>
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>integration-test</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>run</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
       </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
-------------------

  Below is an example post-build BeanShell script (<<<verify.bsh>>>) that checks for the existence of a JAR file after
  the build has run.  If the JAR file does not exist, the script throws an exception which causes the Invoker Plugin to
  log that the build failed. More precisely, any non-null return value which does not equal <<<true>>> will be interpreted
  as a failure condition. And of course, if the script exists abnormally due to an exception, the plugin will flag the
  corresponding build as a failure, too.

-------------------
import java.io.*;

File file = new File( basedir, "target/my-test-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" );
if ( !file.isFile() )
{
    throw new FileNotFoundException( "Could not find generated JAR: " + file );
}
-------------------

  Complementary to the post-build hook script, you can also create a pre-build hook script that will be run before
  the invocation of Maven. This can be used to do some preparations for the build.

  To allow the scripts to access some useful data about the test project, the following global variables will be
  defined by the Invoker Plugin before running the script:

*--------------------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+--------+
|| Name                    || Type                || Description                                              || Since |
*--------------------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+--------+
| <<<basedir>>>            | <<<java.io.File>>>   | The absolute path to the base directory of the test project. | 1.0   |
*--------------------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+--------+
| <<<localRepositoryPath>>>| <<<java.io.File>>>   | The absolute path to the local repository used for the Maven invocation on the test project. | 1.3   |
*--------------------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+--------+
| <<<context>>>            | <<<java.util.Map>>>  | The storage of key-value pairs used to pass data from the pre-build hook script to the post-build hook script. | 1.4   |
*--------------------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+--------+
