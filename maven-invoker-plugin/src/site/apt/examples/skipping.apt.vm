Skipping Invocations

  The Invoker Plugin usually performs an installation setup and runs the configured Maven invocations. Since version
  1.4 of the plugin all these steps may be skipped.

  To skip running the invocations for a particular project, set the <<<skipInvocation>>> property to <<<true>>>. The
  artifact staging to a local repository can be skipped by setting the parameter <<<skipInstallation>>> to <<<true>>>.

  All these steps can also be omited via the command line by use of the <<<invoker.skip>>> property:
  
+---+
mvn install -Dinvoker.skip=true
