Maven 2 Invoker Plugin

  The Invoker Plugin is used to run a set of Maven projects.  The plugin can determine whether each
  project execution is successful, and optionally can verify the output generated from a given 
  project execution.
  
* Goals Overview

  The Invoker Plugin has two goals:

  * {{{install-mojo.html}invoker:install}} copies the project artifacts into the local repository to prepare the
    execution of the integration tests.

  * {{{run-mojo.html}invoker:run}} runs a set of Maven projects in a directory and verifies the result.

  []

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Invoker Plugin can be found on the {{{usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the mail archive.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.

* Examples

  The following example configurations are available to illustrate selected use cases in more detail:

  * {{{examples/clone-projects.html}Clone projects}} to a new directory before running.

  * {{{examples/install-artifacts.html}Install}} projects artifacts to a local repository before running.

  * {{{examples/post-build-script.html}Run a BeanShell or Groovy script}} to verify project output.

  * {{{examples/fast-use.html}Fast Invoker Plugin configuration}} to accelerate test execution.

  * {{{examples/access-test-classes.html}Access test classes}} to share code between IT scripts.

  * {{{examples/invoker-properties.html}Using Invoker Properties}} to configure goals, profiles etc. for individual projects.

  * {{{examples/prepare-build-env.html}Preparing the Build Environment}} by building some setup projects before other projects.
