Manifest customization

* The Default Manifest

  The default contents of the manifest is described in the documentation for
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-archiver/examples/manifest.html}Maven Archiver}}.

  Starting with version 2.1, the maven-jar-plugin uses Maven Archiver 2.1. This
  means that it no longer creates the Specification and Implementation details
  in the manifest by default. If you want them you have to say so explicitly in
  your plugin configuration. This is also is described in the documentation for
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-archiver/examples/manifest.html}Maven Archiver}}.

* Customization the Manifest

  The default manifest can be altered with the <<<archive>>> configuration
  element. Below you will find some of the configuration options that are
  available. For more info see the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-archiver/index.html}Maven Archiver reference}}.
