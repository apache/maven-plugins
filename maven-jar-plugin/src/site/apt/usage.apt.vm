Usage

  Some brief examples on how to use this plugin. If you want to use advanced
  configurations you should have a look at the 
  {{{./index.html#Examples}Example section}}.
  documentation for
  {{{/shared/maven-archiver/}Maven Archiver}}.

  To handle archiving this version of Maven JAR Plugin uses
  {{{/shared/maven-archiver/index.html}Maven Archiver}} ${mavenArchiverVersion}.

  <<Note:>> If you need to sign your JAR files you should use the 
  {{{/plugins/maven-jarsigner-plugin/}Maven Jarsigner Plugin}} instead. 

* How to build a JAR file

  When you want to create a JAR-file with Maven, you first have to create a <<<pom.xml>>>-file with at least the following content:

+----------+
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  
  <groupId>com.mycompany.project</groupId>
  <artifactId>core</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <!-- <packaging>jar</packaging>  -->
</project>
+----------+
  
  Since 'jar' is the default packaging type it is not required to set it in this case.
  Apart from the above you will normally want some real java source files which should be located within
  <<<src/main/java>>>. If you need extra resources on your classpath (for example property files) 
  they should be located in <<<src/main/resources>>>.
  Now we can create a JAR-file by using the command below:

+-----------------+
mvn package
+-----------------+

  The 'package' phase is always responsible for bundling all the files in the artifact, in this case a JAR-file.

  In your project's <<<target>>> directory you'll see the generated jar file which is named like:
  'core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar'. The resulting 'jar' file contains the compiled java class files as well as
  the files from <<<src/main/resources>>>.

  Usually there is no need to mentioned the 'maven-jar-plugin' explicit cause it's bound to
  the {{{/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html}Maven Build Life Cycle}}.
