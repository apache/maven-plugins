      <question>Why is there no documentation for the archive parameter?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The archive parameter is a class that resides outside of this plugin,
          in the Maven Archiver component. You can find the documentation for
          Maven Archiver
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-archiver/index.html">here</a>.
