Grouping Packages

 To set a grouping for different packages, use the {{{../javadoc-mojo.html#groups}\<groups/\>}} parameter as shown
 below. Each group will be consist of a \<title/\> and a \<packages/\> (as String). The \<packages/\> element supports
 wildcard (*) to allow subpackages. If more than one package is to be included, each package name must be separated
 colon (:) separated (similar to the
 {{{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/windows/javadoc.html#group}Javadoc Tool}}).

 For instance, with the following packages:

+-----+
com.mycompany.myapp
com.mycompany.myapp.package1
com.mycompany.myapp.package1.subpackage1
com.mycompany.myapp.package1.subpackage2
com.mycompany.myapp.package1.subpackage3
com.mycompany.myapp.package1.util
com.mycompany.myapp.package2
com.mycompany.myapp.package2.subpackage4
com.mycompany.myapp.package2.subpackage5
com.mycompany.myapp.package2.util
+-----+

  You could have the following configuration:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting> (or <build>)
    <plugins>
      <plugin>

              <title>Example 1 - Group Packages</title>
