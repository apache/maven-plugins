Generate Javadoc without duplicate execution of phase generate-sources.

 * The standard goals <<<javadoc>>> and <<<test-javadoc>>> invoke separate lifecyles
 <<<generate-sources>>> and <<<generate-test-sources>>>.

 * In a CI environment you now might execute something like <<<mvn clean deploy site site-deploy>>>.

 * During <<<site>>> build the standard reports will trigger <<<generate-sources>>> or
 <<<generate-test-sources>>> again, depending on your build this may take some time, because
 stuff like <<<enforcer>>> or generating stubs from a WDSL will be invoked again, which may lead
 to longer build times.

 * See {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MJAVADOC-369}MJAVADOC-369}} as well.

 * As of version 2.10 two new reports are defined, <<<javadoc-no-fork>>> and <<<test-javadoc-no-fork>>>
 which will not trigger above phases a second time.

 * Configure this in your <<<reporting>>> section as follows:
