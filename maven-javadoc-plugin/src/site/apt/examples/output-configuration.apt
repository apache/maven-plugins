Using Alternative Output Directory

 To run the Javadocs reports in an other output directory, you need to configure Javadoc Plugin as follow:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <reportOutputDirectory>${project.reporting.outputDirectory}/myoutput</reportOutputDirectory>
          <destDir>myapidocs</destDir>
          ...
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

  Running <<<mvn javadoc:javadoc>>> will output the Javadoc in the
  <$\{project.reporting.outputDirectory\}/myoutput/myapidocs> instead of the default directory, i.e.
  <$\{project.reporting.outputDirectory\}/apidocs>.

 <<Note>>: Running <mvn site> will automatically use the <$\{project.reporting.outputDirectory\}> directory and
 in this case, <reportOutputDirectory> has no effect. Only, <testDestDir> and <destDir> could be used.
