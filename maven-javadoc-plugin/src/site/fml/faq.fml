      <question>In which part of the pom.xml does the Javadoc plugin should be configured?</question>
      <answer><p>You can configura the Javadoc plugin in the <i>reporting</i> section of your pom.xml if you want to include it in the site generation process (e.g. mvn site). You can also configure it in the <i>build</i> section of your pom if the configuration is different on the site or the report is not included on the site at all.</p></answer>
