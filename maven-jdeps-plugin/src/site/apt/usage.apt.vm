Usage

 The JDeps Plugin verifies classes using the jdeps tool. The following examples describe the basic usage of the
 Plugin.

* Verify Classes As Part Of The Build

 To verify the classes as part of build, you should add the JDeps Plugin in the \<build\> section of your pom:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>jdkinternals</goal> <!-- verify main classes -->
              <goal>test-jdkinternals</goal> <!-- verify test classes -->
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
        <configuration>
          ...
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 If there is any usage detected of an internal API, the build will stop and fail.
