${project.name}

  The JLink Plugin is intended to create a {{{http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/220}Modular Run-Time Images}}
  via {{{http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/282}jlink}}.
    
  NOTE: This is an alpha release which means everything can change until we reach the first
  milestone release.

* Goals Overview

  The JLink Plugin has two goals:

  * {{{./jlink-mojo.html}jlink:jlink}} create a Java Run Time Image from <<jar>>/<<jmod>> files.

  * {{{./help-mojo.html}jlink:help}} displays help information on maven-jlink-plugin.

  []

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the JLink Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your

  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
