Using the Linkcheck plugin

  The Maven Linkcheck Plugin allows you generate a link check report of your documentation.

* Using the Linkcheck plugin from the command-line

  The Linkcheck plugin can be called to execute from the command-line without any
  additional configurations. Like the other plugins, to run the Linkcheck plugin,
  you use:

+-----
<project>
  [...]
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-linkcheck-plugin</artifactId>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  [...]
</project>
+-----

  The Linkcheck plugin needs to call the <<<site>>> phase twice:

+-----
  mvn site (to generate the site phase, i.e. the documentation)
  mvn site (to analyze the result of the generated documentation)
+-----

 Here is a simple report:

~~ * Running the Linkcheck plugin automatically during a build
~~
~~   The Linkcheck plugin can be put into a project's pom.xml so that it gets executed
~~   everytime the project is built.  Below is a sample pom.xml for running the
~~   Linkcheck plugin in the <<<post-site>>> phase everytime the project is built:
~~
~~ +-----
~~ <project>
~~   [...]
~~   <build>
~~     <plugins>
~~       <plugin>
~~         <artifactId>maven-inkcheck-plugin</artifactId>
~~         <executions>
~~           <execution>
~~             <id>site-linkcheck</id>
~~             <phase>post-site</phase>
~~             <goals>
~~               <goal>linkcheck</goal>
~~             </goals>
~~           </execution>
~~         </executions>
~~       </plugin>
~~     </plugins>
~~   </build>
~~   [...]
~~ </project>
