Maven 2 One Plugin

  This plugin provides some integration tasks with Maven 1.x:

   * Helps you to switch your project from Maven 1 to Maven 2 by converting your <<<project.xml>>> to a <<<pom.xml>>>

   * Provides a packaging mechanism for Maven 1.x plugins, building them using Maven 2.0

   * Provides a hook for installation that will copy built artifacts into a local or remote Maven 1.x repository, for
     concurrent development with Maven 1.x projects
