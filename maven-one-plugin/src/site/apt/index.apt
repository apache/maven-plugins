Maven One Plugin

  This plugin provides some integration tasks with Maven 1.x:

   * Helps you to switch your project from Maven 1 to Maven 2 by converting your <<<project.xml>>> to a <<<pom.xml>>>

   * Provides a packaging mechanism for Maven 1.x plugins, building them using Maven 2.0

   * Provides a hook for installation that will copy built artifacts into a local or remote Maven 1.x repository, for
     concurrent development with Maven 1.x projects

* Goals Overview

  * {{{convert-mojo.html}one:convert}} convert a Maven 1 project.xml (v3 pom) to a Maven 2 pom.xml (v4 pom).

  * {{{deploy-maven-one-repository-mojo.html}one:deploy-maven-one-repository}} deploy an artifact into a Maven 1 remote repository.

  * {{{install-maven-one-repository-mojo.html}one:install-maven-one-repository}} install an artifact into the Maven 1 local repository.
