* Questions

** {1.} What would a patch plugin even be used for?

** Answer

  In certain environments direct source modification is not 
  allowed so to make alterations to the source you need some patch 
  application process.  This plugin seeks to address those situations.
   
** {2.} Why won't this work on windows?

** Answer

  This patch wraps the gnu patch tool, which must be in your path
  in order to function properly.  You might able to get this plugin working 
  within cygwin.
    
  If you would like to add windows support to this plugin, please do and 
  submit modifications through the normal project mechansims.
