Maven Doxia

 Doxia is a content generation framework which aims to provide its users with powerful
 techniques for generating static and dynamic content: Doxia can be used in web-based
 publishing context to generate static sites, in addition to being incorporated into
 dynamic content generation systems like blogs, wikis and content management systems.

 Doxia supports markup languages with simple syntaxes. Lightweight markup languages
 are used by people who might be expected to read the document source as well as the rendered output.

 Doxia is used extensively by Maven and it powers the entire documentation system of Maven.
 It gives Maven the ability to take any document that Doxia supports and output it any format.

* Brief History

 Based on the {{{http://www.xmlmind.com/aptconvert.html}Aptconvert}} project developed by
 {{{http://www.xmlmind.com/}Xmlmind}} company, Doxia was initially hosted by Codehaus, to become
 a sub-project of Maven early in 2006.

* Main Features

  * Developed in Java

  * Support of several markup formats: APT (Almost Plain Text), Confluence, DocBook,
    FML (FAQ Markup Language), LaTeX, RTF, TWiki, XDoc (popular in Apache land), XHTML

~~ iText should be replaced by FOP

  * Macro support

  * No need to have a corporate infrastructure (like wiki) to host your documentation
