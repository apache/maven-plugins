Known Bugs and Limitations

  Just a brief selection...

* Current limitations

  * FML parsing doesn't work due to {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DOXIA-148}DOXIA-148}}.

  * Xdoc tables don't work due to a bug in the xdoc parser.

  * Links to other source documents have to start with "./" or "../".

* Missing features

  * Only .png graphics format is supported (currently a FO sink limitation)

* Known bugs

  None.

* FOP vs iText

  PDF can be rendered either using FOP (the default) or iText. The generated document is different.

  One unexpected difference is visible on some special characters: FOP displays '#', while iText displays
  nothing. For example:

  * '\u0092': Unicode Character 'PRIVATE USE TWO' (U+0092)

  * '\u2032': Unicode Character 'PRIME' (U+2032)

  * '\u2033': Unicode Character 'DOUBLE PRIME' (U+2033)

  * '\u203e': Unicode Character 'OVERLINE' (U+203E)
