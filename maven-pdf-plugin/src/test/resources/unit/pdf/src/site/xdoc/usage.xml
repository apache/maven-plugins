    <section name="Using the PDF plugin">

      <p>
        The Maven PDF Plugin allows you generate a PDF document of your documentation.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Using the PDF plugin from the command-line">
        <p>
          The PDF plugin can be called to execute from the command-line without any
          additional configurations.  Like the other plugins, to run the PDF plugin,
         you use:
        </p>
        <source>mvn pdf:pdf</source>
        <p>
          where the first <tt>pdf</tt> refers to the plugin's alias, and the second
          <tt>pdf</tt> refers to a plugin goal.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Running the PDF plugin automatically during a build">
        <p>
          The PDF plugin can be put into a project's pom.xml so that it gets executed
          everytime the project is built.  Below is a sample pom.xml for running the
          PDF plugin in the <tt>site</tt> phase everytime the project is built:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-pdf-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>site-pdf</id>
            <phase>site</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>pdf</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
