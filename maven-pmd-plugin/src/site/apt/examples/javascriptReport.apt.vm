Analyzing JavaScript Code

 The PMD plugin analyzes by default java. You can configure it to analyze JavaScript files instead as shown below.

 The example assumes that the javascript source code is stored in the subfolder <<<src/main/javascript>>> and
 enables three built-in rulesets (<basic>, <braces>, <unnecessary>).

 Note that you have to make sure that the build-helper-maven-plugin is executed, so that the additional source folder
 is actually added. To generate the site report, you can include e.g. the <generate-sources> phase:

 <<<mvn generate-sources site>>>
