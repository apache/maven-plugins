Analyzing JavaScript Code

 The PMD plugin analyzes Java by default. You can configure it to analyze JavaScript files instead as shown below.

 The example assumes that the JavaScript source code is stored in the subdirectory <<<src/main/javascript>>> and
 enables three built-in rulesets (<basic>, <braces>, <unnecessary>).

 Note that you have to make sure that you configure <<<compileSourceRoots>>> and <<<includes>>>, so that
 PMD finds the JavaScript files.
