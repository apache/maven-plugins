Target JDK

 There is a configuration element in the PMD plugin that lets you set which
 {{{../pmd-mojo.html#targetJdk}target JDK}} your Java code will be compiled for.
 Often you want this to be in sync with the configuration for maven-compiler-plugin.
 The best practice for this is to set up the wellknown property <<<maven.compiler.target>>>
 and the rest will work automatically. Alternatively, you can set it manually:

+--------------------+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-pmd-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <targetJdk>1.6</targetJdk>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
