Using Rule Sets

 The PMD plugin uses three default rule sets: <basic.xml>, <unusedcode.xml> and <imports.xml>. These rule sets are
 bundled in the PMD code analysis tool (see the {{{http://pmd.sourceforge.net/rules/index.html}ruleset index}}). To use other
 rule sets, you can configure it in the plugin as shown below.

 The rule sets may reside in the classpath, filesystem or at a URL. For rule sets that are bundled with the PMD tool,
 you do not need to specificy the absolute path of the file. It will be resolved by the plugin. But if the rule set is a
 custom rule set, you need to specify its absolute path.
