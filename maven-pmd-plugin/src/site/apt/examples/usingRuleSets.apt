Using Rule Sets

 The PMD plugin uses three default rule sets: basic.xml, unusedcode.xml and imports.xml. These rule sets are bundled in
 the PMD code analysis tool ({{{http://pmd.sourceforge.net/rules/index.html}more info}}). To use other
 rule sets, you can configure the plugin as shown below:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-pmd-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <rulesets>
            <ruleset>/rules/braces.xml</ruleset>
            <ruleset>/rules/naming.xml</ruleset>
            <ruleset>d:\rulesets\strings.xml</ruleset>
            <ruleset>http://localhost/design.xml</ruleset>
          </rulesets>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 The rulesets may reside in the classpath, filesystem or at a URL. For rule sets that are already bundled with the PMD tool,
 you do not need to specificy the absolute path of the file. It will be resolved by the plugin. But if the rule set is a
 custom rule set, you need to specify its absolute path.
