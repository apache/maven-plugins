Maven 2 PMD Plugin

  The {{{http://pmd.sourceforge.net/}PMD}} plugin allows you to automatically run the PMD code analysis tool
  on your project's source code and generate a site report with its results. It also supports the separate
  Copy/Paste Detector tool (or CPD) distributed with PMD.

  The plugin accepts configuration parameters that can be used to customize the execution of the PMD tool.


* Goals Overview

  This plugin has 4 goals:

  * {{{pmd-mojo.html}pmd:pmd}} creates a PMD site report based on the rulesets and configuration set in the plugin.
    It can also generate a pmd output file aside from the site report in any of the following formats: xml, csv or txt.

  * {{{cpd-mojo.html}pmd:cpd}} generates a report for PMD's Copy/Paste Detector (CPD) tool.  It can also
    generate a cpd results file in any of these formats: xml, csv or txt.

  * {{{check-mojo.html}pmd:check}} verifies that the PMD report is empty and fails the build if it is not. This goal is executed by
    default when <<<pmd:pmd>>> is executed.

  * {{{cpd-check-mojo.html}pmd:cpd-check}} verifies that the CPD report is empty and fails the build if it is not. This goal is
    executed by default when <<<pmd:cpd>>> is executed.

* Usage

   Instructions on how to use the PMD Plugin can be found {{{usage.html}here}}.

* Examples

   More advanced usecases for the plugin are available under the Examples menu.
