Customize the Text Reports

  Actually, all reports have a static renderer, only texts could be changed.

  <<Note:>> This feature is only available in version 2.3+ of this plugin.

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-project-info-reports-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <!-- By default -->
          <customBundle>\${project.basedir}/src/site/custom/project-info-report.properties</customBundle>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+

  To change texts in the reports, you should import the default Project Info report bundles from
  {{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugins/trunk/maven-project-info-reports-plugin/src/main/resources/}}
  and edit them. For example, if you want to modify the Mailing List introduction, you should edit the report.mailing-lists.intro property.

  Extract of the default bundle {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugins/trunk/maven-project-info-reports-plugin/src/main/resources/project-info-report.properties}project-info-report.properties}}:

+-----------------+
report.mailing-lists.intro = These are the mailing lists that have been established for this project. For each list, there is a subscribe, unsubscribe, and an archive link.
+-----------------+

  Extract of a custom bundle $\{project.basedir\}/src/site/custom/project-info-report.properties for the Apache Commons project:

+-----------------+

report.mailing-lists.intro = These are the mailing lists that have been established for this project. For each list, there is a subscribe, unsubscribe, and an archive link.\
        <p>\

            The <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/commons-dev/" class="externalLink">Developer List</a>\

            If not, then subscribe to the appropriate list and post your question.\

        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> please don't send patches or attachments to any of the mailing lists.\
            Patches are best handled via the <i>Issue Tracking</i> system.\
            Otherwise, please upload the file to a public server and include the URL in the mail.\
