Customize the SCM Report

  By default, the SCM Report uses the information configured (or inherited)
  in the <<<\<scm\>>>> element of <<<pom.xml>>>. To override these values,
  you can configure the <<<webAccessUrl>>>, <<<anonymousConnection>>> and
  <<<developerConnection>>> properties.

  This feature is useful when the project website is stored in
  a separate module, and you want the SCM report to give instructions for
  checking out the project trunk.

  <<Note:>> This feature is available in version 2.1+ of this plugin.

<project>
  ...
  <scm>
    <connection>scm:svn:http://svn.example.org/repo/project/trunk/site</connection>
    <developerConnection>scm:svn:https://svn.example.org/repo/project/trunk/site</developerConnection>
    <url>http://svn.example.org/viewvc/project/trunk/site</url>

* {How to exclude SCM anonymous access info?}

 Just do not specify the <<<\<connection/\>>>> tag in the <<<\<scm/\>>>> tag. For instance, you could have:

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <scm>
    <!-- Unspecified <connection/> tag -->
    <developerConnection>scm:svn:https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugins/trunk/maven-project-info-reports-plugin/</developerConnection>
    <url>http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/plugins/trunk/maven-project-info-reports-plugin/</url>
  </scm>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+

  <<Note>>: Due to {{{http://plexus.codehaus.org}Plexus}} design, it is not possible to specify an empty value using
  the <<<\<anonymousConnection/\>>>> configuration element.
