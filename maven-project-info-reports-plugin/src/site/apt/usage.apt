Usage

 Maven has been configured to create the project info reports by default. There's
 no need to configure anything in your <<<pom.xml>>> to generate the project
 information reports.

 Simply running <<<mvn site>>> would generate the project information documentation.
 For more information on how to customize the Project Information Reports Plugin,
 check the examples on the {{{./index.html}Introduction}} page.
