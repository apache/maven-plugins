Include extra files in the RAR

  Extra files may also be included in the generated archive(rar). By default,
  all files placed inside the <<<src/main/rar>>> will be included.

+---+
project
|--pom.xml
|--src
   `--main
      |--rar
      |  `-- <!-- put the extra files here -->
      |--java
         [...]
+---+

  Then execute the plugin by invoking the <<<rar:rar>>> goal.

+---+
mvn rar:rar
+---+

  To be able to change the location of the directory, configure the
  <<<rarSourceDirectory>>> property and set a path for it.
