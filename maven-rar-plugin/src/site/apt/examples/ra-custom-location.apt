Custom location of the Resource Adapter Descriptor

   It is also possible to specify a custom location for the ra.xml file. For
   instance to use the file located in <<<src/resources/ra.xml>>>, configure your
   project as follows:

+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-rar-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
           <raXmlFile>src/resources/ra.xml</raXmlFile>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+----+

   Then execute the plugin by invoking the <<<rar:rar>>> goal.

+----+
mvn rar:rar
+----+
