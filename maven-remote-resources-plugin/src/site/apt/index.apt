Maven 2 Remote Resources Plugin

  This plugin is used to retrieve JARs of resources from remote repositories,
  processes those resources, and incorporate them into JARs you build with
  Maven. A very common use-case is the need to package certain resources in a
  consistent way across your organization: at Apache it is required that every
  JAR produced contains a copy of the Apache license and a notice file that
  references all used software in a given project.

* Goals Overview

  * {{{bundle-mojo.html}remote-resources:bundle}} creates the resource bundle manifest required
    by the remote resource bundle processing. The manifest file,
    <<<${basedir}/target/classes/META-INF/maven/remote-resources.xml>>>, is created from the contents of the
    <<<src/main/resources>>> directory.

  * {{{process-mojo.html}remote-resources:process}} retrieves the specified
    remote resource bundles, processes them and makes them available to the
    process-resources phase.
