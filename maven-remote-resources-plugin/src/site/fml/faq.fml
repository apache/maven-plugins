    <faq id="question1">
      <question>Why do I need to use this plugin?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This plugin greatly reduces the pain associated with consistent packaging concerns across
          a large set of projects, or an entire organization. Any project can specify the use of a
          remote resource bundle and have the resources incorporated into their packaging. This means
          that you can create standard settings in a parent POM somewhere in the project hierarchy and
          have all projects use packaged common resources in a standard way like licenses, other legal
          notices and disclaimers, or anything else that may be common.

    <faq id="question2">
      <question>The generated files have a lot of missing information.  Looking at the POMs from
        the dependencies, the information isn't there either.  What can I do?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          There are two solutions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            File bugs with the projects that produced those artifacts to get them to fix them.  Also,
            file bugs with the
            <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MEV">Maven Evangelism</a>
            project to have the Maven people enhance the metadata in the repository.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a supplemental data file.  You can create a file that contains the missing metadata.
            For example:
            <source><![CDATA[
              <supplementalDataModels>
                <supplement>
                  <project>
                    <groupId>com.sun.xml.bind</groupId>
                    <artifactId>jaxb-impl</artifactId>
                    <name>Sun JAXB Reference Implementation Runtime</name>
                    <organization>
                      <name>Sun Microsystems</name>
                      <url>http://www.sun.com/</url>
                    </organization>
                    <licenses>
                      <license>
                        <name>COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) Version 1.0</name>
                        <url>http://www.sun.com/cddl/cddl.html</url>
                      </license>
                    </licenses>
                  </project>
                </supplement>
              </supplementalDataModels>]]>
            </source>
            That location of that file can then be configured with the
            <code>supplementalModels</code> configuration element for the <code>process</code> goal.  The
            supplemental information is merged with the information provided from the repository.
