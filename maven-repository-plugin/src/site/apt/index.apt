Maven Repository Plugin

  This plugin is used to create bundles of artifacts that can be uploaded to the
  central repository.

* Goals Overview

  * {{{bundle-create-mojo.html}repository:bundle-create}} Creates an upload bundle for a project built with Maven.

  * {{{bundle-pack-mojo.html}repository:bundle-pack}} Creates an upload bundle for an artifact that exists in your local repository.

  []

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Repository Plugin can be found on the {{{usage.html}usage page}}.
  Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the
  {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Repository+Plugin}plugin's wiki page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
