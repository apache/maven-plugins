      <question>How can I create an upload bunde for a project that I don't build using maven?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          You can manually add the artifact to your local repository, creating a pom and optionally adding source and
          javadoc jars. Then you can run "mvn repository:bundle-pack" that will prompt you for groupId, artifactId and
          version and generate a bundle you can use for an upload request.
