Including and excluding files and directories

 When specifying a resource directory, every file within that directory may not
 be used. Thus, we may have to specify only the files that we want to include or
 specify the files that we want to exclude.

 To include a resource, we only need to add an <<<\<includes\>>>> element.

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <name>My Resources Plugin Practice Project</name>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <resources>
      <resource>
        <directory> [your directory] </directory>
        <includes>
          <include> [resource file #1] </include>
          <include> [resource file #2] </include>
          <include> [resource file #3] </include>
          ...
          <include> [resource file #n] </include>
        </includes>
      </resource>
      ...
    </resources>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 And to exclude a resource, we only need to add an <<<\<excludes\>>>> element.

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <name>My Resources Plugin Practice Project</name>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <resources>
      <resource>
        <directory> [your directory] </directory>
        <excludes>
          <exclude> [non-resource file #1] </exclude>
          <exclude> [non-resource file #2] </exclude>
          <exclude> [non-resource file #3] </exclude>
          ...
          <exclude> [non-resource file #n] </exclude>
        </excludes>
      </resource>
      ...
    </resources>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>

 For example, if we want to include all text and RTF files under our
 <<<src/my-resources>>> directory and in all its subdirectories, we can do the
 following:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <name>My Resources Plugin Practice Project</name>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <resources>
      <resource>
        <directory> src/my-resources </directory>
        <includes>
          <include> **/*.txt </include>
          <include> **/*.rtf </include>
        </includes>
      </resource>
      ...
    </resources>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 Also, if we want to include everything except the bitmaps, jpegs, and gifs, we
 can simply exclude them by:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <name>My Resources Plugin Practice Project</name>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <resources>
      <resource>
        <directory> src/my-resources </directory>
        <excludes>
          <exclude> **/*.bmp </exclude>
          <exclude> **/*.jpg </exclude>
          <exclude> **/*.jpeg </exclude>
          <exclude> **/*.gif </exclude>
        </excludes>
      </resource>
      ...
    </resources>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 Of course, we can also have both <<<\<includes\>>>> and <<<\<excludes\>>>> elements. For example, if we
 want to include all text files that does not contain the word "test" in their
 filename.

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <name>My Resources Plugin Practice Project</name>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <resources>
      <resource>
        <directory> src/my-resources </directory>
        <includes>
          <include> **/*.txt </include>
        </inclues>
        <excludes>
          <exclude> **/*test*.* </exclude>
        </excludes>
      </resource>
      ...
    </resources>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
