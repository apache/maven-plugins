Specifying resource directories

 By default, Maven will look for your project's resources under
 <<<src/main/resources>>>.

+-----+
Project
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    `-- main
        `-- resources
+-----+

 However, all your resources may not be in <<<src/main/resources>>>. Thus, you'd have
 to specify those directories by adding the following to your POM.

+-----+
<project>
 ...
 <build>
   ...
   <resources>
     <resource>
       <directory> [your folder here] </directory>
     </resource>
   </resources>
   ...
 </build>
 ...
</project>
+-----+

 So if your resources resides in <<<src/my-resources>>>

+-----+
Project
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    `-- my-resources
+-----+

 you can specify that directory by doing the following:

+-----+
   ...
   <resources>
     <resource>
       <directory>src/my-resources</directory>
     </resource>
   </resources>
   ...
+-----+

 Furthermore, you can have several directories by adding multiple <<<\<resource\>>>> elements:

+-----+
   ...
   <resources>
     <resource>
       <directory>resource1</directory>
     </resource>
     <resource>
       <directory>resource2</directory>
     </resource>
     <resource>
       <directory>resource3</directory>
     </resource>
   </resources>
   ...
+-----+
