Maven Resources Plugin

 The Resources Plugin handles the copying of project resources to the output
 directory. There are two different kinds of resources: main resources and test resources. The
 difference is that the main resources are the resources associated to the main
 source code while the test resources are associated to the test source code.

 Thus, this allows the separation of resources for the main source code and its
 unit tests.

* Goals Overview

   The Resources Plugin has two goals:

   * {{{resources-mojo.html}resources:resources}} copies the
     resources for the main source code to the main output directory.

   * {{{testResources-mojo.html}resources:testResources}} copies the
     resources for the test source code to the test output directory.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Resources Plugin can be found on the {{{usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the
  {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Resources+Plugin}plugin's wiki page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.

* Examples

   The following examples show how to use the Resources Plugin in more advanced
   usecases:

   * {{{examples/encoding.html}Specifying a character encoding scheme}}

   * {{{examples/resource-directory.html}Specifying resource directories}}

   * {{{examples/filter.html}Filtering}}

   * {{{examples/include-exclude.html}Including and excluding files and
      directories}}
