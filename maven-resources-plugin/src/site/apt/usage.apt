Usage

 The Resources Plugin handles the copying of project resources to the output
 directory. The following examples describe the basic usage of the Plugin.

* Copy resources for the main source code

+-----+
mvn resources:resources
+-----+

 Upon executing this command, the resources for your main source code will be
 copied to your main build output directory. This does not affect the
 resources for your test code.

 Moreover, this goal is bound to the <<<process-resources>>> phase.

* Copy resources for the unit tests

+-----+
mvn resources:testResources
+-----+

 Like the first goal this goal copies resources, but this time for your test source code to your
 test build output directory. Also, this does not affect the resources for the main source
 code.

 Furthermore, this is bound to the <<<process-test-resources>>> phase.
