For use in 2.0.4 we need to have the:

1. The SinkFactory from doxia-sink-api
2. The MavenMultiPageReport from maven-reporting

?      src/main/java/org/apache/maven/doxia
?      src/main/java/org/apache/maven/reporting
?      src/main/java/org/codehaus

plexus-utils 1.1 is in the core but that can easily be upgraded for 2.0.5.
