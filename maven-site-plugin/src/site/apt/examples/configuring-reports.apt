Configuring Reports

  Maven has several reports that you can add to your web site to display the
  current state of the project. These reports take the form of plugins, just
  like those used to build the project.

  There are many standard reports that are available by extracting information
  from the POM. Currently these are provided by default:

  * Continous Integration

  * Dependencies

  * Issue Tracking

  * License

  * Mailing Lists

  * Project Team

  * Source Repository

  []

  To find out more please see to the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-project-info-reports-plugin/}Project Info Reports Plugin}}.

  To add these reports to your site, you must add the plugin to the
  <<<\<reporting\>>>> element in the POM. The following example shows how to
  configure the standard Project Info Reports that display information from the
  POM in a friendly format:

-------------------
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-project-info-reports-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.1.1</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
-------------------

  If you have included the appropriate <<<\<menu ref="reports"/\>>>> tag in your
  {{{sitedescriptor.html}site descriptor}}, then when you regenerate the site
  those items will appear in a menu called "Project Reports".

  <<Note:>> Many report plugins provide a parameter called <<<outputDirectory>>>
  or similar to specify the destination for their report outputs. This parameter
  is only relevant if the report plugin is run standalone, i.e. by invocation
  directly from the command line. In constrast, when reports are generated as
  part of the site, the configuration of the Maven Site Plugin will determine
  the effective output directory to ensure that all reports end up in a common
  location.

  Check out the <reporting> section of the {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/}plugins page}},
  for a list of available reporting plugins.
