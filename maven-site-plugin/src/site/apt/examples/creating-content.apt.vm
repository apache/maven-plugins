Creating Content

  Now it's time to create some content for your site. In Maven 2, the site
  content is structured by format, as there are several formats supported.

%{toc|section=1|fromDepth=2|toDepth=3}

* Documentation formats

  Here's an example of a directory structure for a site:

-------------------
+- src/
   +- site/
      +- apt/
      |  +- index.apt
      |
      +- fml/
      |  +- general.fml
      |  +- faq.fml
      |
      +- markdown/
      |  +- markup.md
      |
      +- xdoc/
      |  +- other.xml
      |
      +- xhtml/
      |  +- xhtml-too.xhtml
      |
      +- site.xml
--------------------

 The <<<$\{basedir\}/src/site>>> directory which contains a site
 descriptor along with various directories corresponding to the supported
 document formats. Let's take a look at examples of the various document
 formats.

  * APT:
  The APT format ("Almost Plain Text") is a wiki-like format that allows you to
  write simple, structured documents (like this one) very quickly. A full
  reference of the
  {{{/doxia/references/apt-format.html} APT Format}} is
  available.

  * FML:
  The FML format is the FAQ format. This is the same that were used in Maven 1.x.
  For more info about the
  {{{/doxia/references/fml-format.html}FML Format}}
  check the {{{/doxia/}Doxia}} site.

  * XDoc:
  The XDoc format is the same as
  {{{/maven-1.x/using/site.html} used in Maven 1.x}}.
  A reference for the
  {{{/doxia/references/xdoc-format.html} XDoc Format}}
  is available.

  * Markdown (since maven-site-plugin 3.3):
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown} Markdown}} is a widespread Markup language.

  []

  Other formats are available, but the above four are recognized by default by the site plugin.
  Any other document format for which a Doxia parser exists can be used as well (see the list of
  {{{/doxia/references/index.html}Doxia Markup Languages}}),
  but in this case you need to add the corresponding Doxia dependency to your site plugin configuration, as
  explained in the last paragraph.
  Note that Doxia also supports several output formats, the site plugin only creates XHTML.

  Note that all of the above is optional - just one index file is required in
  one of the input trees. The paths under each format will be merged together
  to form the root directory of the site. After running '<<<mvn site:site>>>'
  on the example above you will end up with this in your <<<target>>> directory:

-------------------
+- target/
   +- site/
      +- css/
      |
      +- images/
      |
      +- index.html
      +- general.html
      +- faq.html
      +- other.html
--------------------

  This means that <<</src/site/apt/index.apt>>> will be available in the site as
  <<</index.html>>>. So, in {{{./sitedescriptor.html} your site descriptor}} you
  might link to <<</index.html>>> and <<</other.html>>>, where the source of
  these two files would be <<</src/site/apt/index.apt>>> and
  <<</src/site/xdoc/other.xdoc>>>.

  The <<<css>>> and <<<images>>> directories contain stylesheets and images
  from the skin being used. You can read more about skins in
  {{{./sitedescriptor.html}the site descriptor documentation}}.


* Adding Extra Resources

  You can add any arbitrary resource to your site by including them in a
  <<<resources>>> directory as shown below. Additional CSS files can be picked
  up when they are placed in the <<<css>>> directory within the <<<resources>>>
  directory.

-------------------
+- src/
   +- site/
      +- resources/
         +- css/
         |  +- site.css
         |
         +- images/
            +- pic1.jpg
--------------------

  The file <<<site.css>>> will be added to the default XHTML output, so it can
  be used to adjust the default Maven stylesheets if desired.

  The file <<<pic1.jpg>>> will be available via a relative reference to the
  <<<images>>> directory from any page in your site.


* Filtering

  To filter properties into any supported documentation format, add a <<<.vm>>>
  extension to the filename.

  For example, the module for the Maven website contains a
  {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/site/trunk/content/xdoc/download.xml.vm}<<<content/xdoc/download.xml.vm>>>}}
  file, which uses the expression <<<$\{currentStableVersion}>>> to filter in a
  property set in the
  {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/site/trunk/pom.xml}POM}}.

  <<Note:>> {{{http://velocity.apache.org/}Apache Velocity}} is used to apply the filtering.

  Some properties are defined by default: see
  {{{/doxia/doxia-sitetools/doxia-site-renderer/#Velocity_processing} Doxia Site Renderer's Velocity processing reference}}
  for more information. For a complete usage overview, see Velocity's {{{http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html}user guide}}.

  Since version 3.5, you can save processed markup by setting <<<saveProcessedContent>>> to <<<true>>>: see
  {{{../site-mojo.html#saveProcessedContent}corresponding documentation}} for more details.

** Common Issues and Workarounds

  * <<dotted properties>>:

  As Velocity uses a dot-notation to traverse beans, you <<cannot>>
  use dotted properties defined in <<<\<properties\>>>> directly.

  It is generally advised to access properties by using the <<<${esc.d}context>>> tool:
  e.g., with <<<${esc.d}context.get("my.property")>>>.

  * <<Markdown conflict with Velocity on ${esc.h}${esc.h} syntax>>:

  Since <<<${esc.h}${esc.h}>>> denotes a
  {{{http://velocity.apache.org/engine/1.7/vtl-reference.html#single-line-comments}single line comment}} in Velocity,
  Markdown headers using this syntax are suppressed from generated content.

  You can use {{{http://velocity.apache.org/engine/1.7/vtl-reference.html#unparsed-content}unparsed content syntax}}
  <<<${esc.h}[[#[[##]]#]]${esc.h}>>> or
  {{{http://velocity.apache.org/tools/2.0/apidocs/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/EscapeTool.html}escape tool}}
  like <<<${esc.d}\{esc.h\}${esc.d}\{esc.h\}>>>.

* Internationalization

  Internationalization in Maven is very simple, as long as the reports you are
  using have that particular locale defined. For an overview of supported
  languages and instructions on how to add further languages, please see the
  related article {{{../i18n.html} Internationalization}}.

  To enable multiple locales, or languages, add a configuration similar to the
  following to your POM:

-------------------
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <locales>en,fr</locales>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
-------------------

  This will generate both an English and a French version of the site. If
  <<<en>>> is your current locale, then it will be generated at the root of the
  site, with a copy of the French translation of the site in the <<<fr/>>>
  subdirectory.

  To add your own content for that translation instead of using the default,
  create a subdirectory with that locale's name in your site directory and
  create a new site descriptor with the name of the locale in the file name.
  For example:

-------------------
+- src/
   +- site/
      +- apt/
      |  +- index.apt     (Default version)
      |
      +- fr/
      |  +- apt/
      |     +- index.apt  (French version)
      |
      +- site.xml         (Default site descriptor)
      +- site_fr.xml      (French site descriptor)
--------------------

  With one site descriptor per language, the translated site(s) can evolve
  independently.
