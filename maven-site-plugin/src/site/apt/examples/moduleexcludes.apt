Excluding Modules

  To exclude specific modules from the site to be generated, you can use the <<<excludeModules>>> parameter.

  For example, you have the following site content in your POM

+-----+
Module1
|-- src
|   |-- main
|   `-- site
|       |-- apt
|       |   `-- sample-apt.apt
|       `-- fml
|           `-- sample-fml.fml
`-- pom.xml
+-----+

  and you want to exclude the whole fml module from the site to be generated, you need to set the following in your POM
  then execute "<<<mvn site>>>".

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <excludeModules>fml</excludeModules>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

  You will see that no <<<sample-fml.html>>> will be generated with the site.
