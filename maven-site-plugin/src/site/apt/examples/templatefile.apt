Changing the Template File

  It is possible to change the Velocity template used for creating the site. In your pom, just add something like this:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
       <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
       <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
       <configuration>
         <templateDirectory>${basedir}</templateDirectory>
         <template>maven-site.vm</template>
       </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

  And execute the site goal from your project. For more information about Velocity, see
