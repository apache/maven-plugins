Maven 2 Site Plugin

 The Maven 2 Site plugin is used to generate a site for the project. The generated site also includes the project's reports
 that were configured in the <<<\<reporting\>>>> section of the pom.

* Goals Overview

   The Site Plugin has six goals:

   * {{{deploy-mojo.html}site:deploy}} is used to deploy the generated site using <<<scp>>> or <<<file>>> protocol to the site
     specified in the <<<\<distributionManagement\>>>> section of the pom.

   * {{{attach-descriptor-mojo.html}site:attach-descriptor}} adds the site descriptor to the list of files to be
     installed/deployed. For more references of the site descriptor, 
     {{{examples/sitedescriptor.html}here's a link}}.

   * {{{site-mojo.html}site:site}} is used generate a site for the project.

   * {{{run-mojo.html}site:run}} starts the site up, rendering documents as requested for faster editing. It uses Jetty
     as the webapp server.

   * {{{stage-deploy-mojo.html}site:stage-deploy}} deploys the generated site in a staging or mock directory on the site
     specified in the <<<\<distributionManagement\>>>> section of the pom. It also supports <<<scp>>> and <<<file>>> protocol for deployment.

   * {{{stage-mojo.html}site:stage}} generates a site in a local staging or mock directory based on the site url specified
     in the <<<\<distributionManagement\>>>> section of the pom.
