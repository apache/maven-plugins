Usage

 You can put additional content (e.g. documentation, resources, etc.) in your
 site. See {{{examples/creating-content.html}Creating Content}} for more
 information on this. If you want to change the menus, breadcrumbs, links or
 logos on your pages you need to add and configure a
 {{{examples/sitedescriptor.html}site descriptor}}. If you like, you also can
 let Maven generate some {{{examples/configuring-reports.html}reports}} for you,
 based on the contents of your POM.

* Generating a Site

  To generate the project's site and reports, execute:

+-----+
mvn site
+-----+

  By default, the resulting site will be in the <<<target/site/>>> directory.

  <<Note:>> If you have a multi module project, then the links between the
  parent and child modules will <not> work when you use '<<<mvn site>>>' or
  '<<<mvn site:site>>>'. If you want to use those links, you should use
  '<<<mvn site:stage>>>' instead. You can read more about that goal further down on
  this page in the section called '<Staging a Site>'.

* Deploying a Site

  To be able to deploy the site, you must first specify where the site will be
  deployed. This is set in the <<<\<distributionManagement\>>>> element of the
  POM as shown below.

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <distributionManagement>
    <site>
      <id>www.yourcompany.com</id>
      <url>scp://www.yourcompany.com/www/docs/project/</url>
    </site>
  </distributionManagement>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

  The <<<\<id\>>>> element identifies the repository, so that you can attach
  credentials to it in your <<<settings.xml>>> file using the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Servers}<<<\<servers\>>>> element}}
  as you would for any other repository.

  The <<<\<url\>>>> gives the location to deploy to. Currently, the <<<scp>>>
  and <<<file>>> protocols are supported. In the example above we copy to the
  host <<<www.mycompany.com>>> using the path <<</www/docs/project/>>>. If
  subprojects inherit the site URL from a parent POM, they will automatically
  append their <<<\<artifactId\>>>> to form their effective deployment location.

  Now you can execute the <<<{{{deploy-mojo.html}site:deploy}}>>> goal from
  your project directory.

  <<Note:>> A site must be generated first before executing <<<site:deploy>>>.

+-----+
mvn site:deploy
+-----+

  If you want to generate the site <and> deploy it in one go, you can utilize
  the <<<site-deploy>>> phase of the site lifecycle. To do this, just execute:

+-----+
mvn site-deploy
+-----+

* Staging a Site

  <<Note:>> This goal is available in version 2.0-beta-5 or later of the Site Plugin.

  To review/test the generated web site before an official deploy, you can stage the site in
  a specific directory. It will use the <<<\<distributionManagement\>>>> element or the project hierarchy to link the
  project and its modules.

  Just execute the <<<{{{stage-mojo.html}site:stage}}>>> goal from your project
  with the <<<stagingDirectory>>> parameter as shown below:

+-----+
mvn site:stage -DstagingDirectory=C:\fullsite
+-----+

  <<Note:>> <<<stagingDirectory>>> cannot be dynamic, i.e. <<<stagingDirectory=$\{basedir\}\fullsite>>>

  To stage a site and to deploy it, just execute the <<<{{{stage-deploy-mojo.html}site:stage-deploy}}>>> goal from your project
  with the required parameters. The <<<site:stage-deploy>>> goal will use the
  id <<<stagingSite>>> for deployment. So if you need to add your username or
  password in <<<settings.xml>>>, you should use <<<\<id\>stagingSite\</id\>>>>
  for that <<<\<server\>>>> section. See the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-deployment-security-settings.html}Guide to Deployment and Security Settings}}
  for more information on this.

+-----+
mvn site:stage-deploy -DstagingDirectory=C:\fullsite \
  -DstagingSiteURL=scp://www.mycompany.com/www/project/
+-----+

  <<Note:>> Due to a bug in Wagon, the password is not always picked up when
  you run the <<<site:stage-deploy>>> goal. The bug has been fixed, but the
  version of Wagon that is used by the Site Plugin is determined by the version
  of Maven you use. The current 2.0.x releases of Maven use a version where
  this bug is still present.

* Running a Site

  The Site Plugin can also be used to start up the site in Jetty. To do this,
  execute:

+-----+
mvn site:run
+-----+

  The server will, by default, be started on <<<http://localhost:8080/>>>. See
  {{{http://jetty.mortbay.org/}http://jetty.mortbay.org/}} for more information about
  the Jetty server.
