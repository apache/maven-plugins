    <faq id="How do I Integrate static (X)HTML pages into my Maven site">
      <question>How do I Integrate static (X)HTML pages into my Maven site?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        You can integrate your static pages by following these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Put your static pages in the resources directory, <code>${basedir}/src/site/resources</code></li>
          <li>Create your <code>site.xml</code> and put it in <code>${basedir}/src/site</code></li>
          <li>Link to the static pages by modifying the menu section, create items and map them to the filenames of the static pages</li>
        </ul>

    <faq id="Why do my absolute links get translated into relative links">
      <question>Why do my absolute links get translated into relative links?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This happens because the Site Plugin tries to make all URLs relative,
          when possible. If you have something like this defined in your
          <code>pom.xml</code>:
          <source>
<url>http://www.your.site.com/</url></source>
          and create links in your <code>site.xml</code> (just an example) like
          this:
          <source>
<links>
  <item name="Your Site" href="http://www.your.site.com/"/>
  <item name="Maven 2" href="http://maven.apache.org/maven2/"/>
</links></source>
          You will see that the link to "Your site" will be a relative one, but
          that the link to "Maven 2" will be an absolute link.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an
          <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSITE-159">issue for this in JIRA</a>,
          where you can read more about this.

    <faq id="Why don't the links between parent and child modules work when I run &quot;mvn site&quot;?">
      <question>Why don't the links between parent and child modules work when I run "<code>mvn site</code>"?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          What "<code>mvn site</code>" will do for you, in a multi-project
          build, is to run "<code>mvn site</code>" for the parent and all its
          modules <b>individually</b>. The links between parent and child will
          <b>not</b> work here. They <b>will</b> however work when you deploy
          the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to test this, prior to deployment, you can run the
          <a href="stage-mojo.html"><code>site:stage</code></a> goal as
          described in the <a href="usage.html">usage documentation</a>
          instead.

    <faq id="How to include a custom Doxia module, like Twiki">
      <question>How to include a custom Doxia module, like Twiki?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The site plugin handles out-of-box apt, xdoc and fml formats. If you
          want to use a custom format like Twiki, you need to specify the
          Doxia Twiki dependency, i.e.:
          <source>
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>

        <dependencies>
          <dependency>

            <version>1.0-alpha-11</version>
          </dependency>
