Usage

 The source plugin can be used to create a jar file of the project sources from the command line or by binding
 the goal to the project's build lifecycle.  To generate the jar from the command line, use the following command:

+-----+
mvn source:jar
+-----+

 A jar file of the test sources can also be generated by executing:

+-----+
mvn source:test-jar
+-----+

*Installing the sources along with your artifact

  There are two ways to do this. You can either bind this plugin to a phase or
  you can add it to a profile.  The goals {{{./jar-no-fork-mojo.html}source:jar-no-fork}} and 
  {{{./test-jar-no-fork-mojo.html}source:test-jar-no-fork}} are preferred for binding 
  the goal to the build lifecycle.

**Installing the sources using a phase binding

  Here is how you would configure the plugin in your <<<pom.xml>>> to run
  automatically during the <verify> phase:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-source-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>attach-sources</id>
            <phase>verify</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>jar-no-fork</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

  We are using the <verify> phase here because it is the phase that comes
  before the <install> phase, thus making sure that the sources jar has been
  created <<before>> the install takes place.

**Installing the sources using a profile

  If you want to install a jar of your sources along with your artifact during
  the release process, you can add this to your <<<pom.xml>>> file:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>release</id>
      <build>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-source-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
            <executions>
              <execution>
                <id>attach-sources</id>
                <goals>
                  <goal>jar-no-fork</goal>
                </goals>
              </execution>
            </executions>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
  ...
</project>
