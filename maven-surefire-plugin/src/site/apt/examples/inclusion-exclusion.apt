Inclusions and Exclusions of Tests

* Inclusions

  By default, the surefire plugin will automatically include all test classes
  with the following wildcard patterns:

   * <"**/Test*.java"> - includes all of its subdirectory and all java
   filename that starts with "Test".

   * <"**/*Test.java"> - includes all of its subdirectory and all java
   filename that ends with "Test".

   * <"**/*TestCase.java"> - includes all of its subdirectory and all java
   filename that ends with "TestCase".

   []

  If the test classes does not go with the naming convention, then configure
  surefire plugin and specify the tests you want to include.

* Exclusions

  There are certain times that some tests are causing the build to fail.
  Excluding them is one of the best workaround to continue the build.
  Exclusions can be done by configuring the <<excludes>> property of the
  plugin.
