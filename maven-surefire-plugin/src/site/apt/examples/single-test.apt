Running a Single Test

  During development, you may run a single test class repeatedly. To run this
  through Maven, set the <<<test>>> property to a specific test case.

+---+
mvn -Dtest=TestCircle test
+---+

  The value for the <<<test>>> parameter is the name of the test class(without
  the extension).
