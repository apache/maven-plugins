Maven Toolchains Plugin

    The Toolchains Plugins allows to share configuration across plugins. For example to make sure the plugins like compiler, surefire, javadoc, webstart etc. all use the same JDK for execution.
Similarly to maven-enforcer-plugin, it allows to control environmental constraints in the build. 

* Goals Overview

  The Toolchains plugin has one goal:

  *{{{toolchain-mojo.html}toolchain:toolchain}} The goal is typically to be attached to the "validate" phase of default lifecycle.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Toolchains Plugin can be found on the {{{usage.html}usage page}}.
  Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the
  {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Toolchains+Plugin}plugin's wiki page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please feel
  free to contact the {{{mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
