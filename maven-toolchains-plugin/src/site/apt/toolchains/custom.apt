Custom Toolchains

  You can create your own custom toolchains with plugins using them.

  A full working sample is included in <<<maven-toolchains-plugin>>> ITs, which are part of 
  {{{../source-repository.html}the plugin source tree}}:

  * see <<<src/it/setup-custom-toolchain>>> for the custom toolchain and plugin,

  * see <<<src/it/use-custom-toolchain>>> for a sample project using the toolchain through its plugin.

  []

  Following instructions are explanations of key points of the sample.

* Creating Custom Toolchain

  A toolchain consists in:

  * an interface extending {{{/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/toolchain/Toolchain.html}<<<org.apache.maven.toolchain.Toolchain>>>}},

  * an implementation of this interface. Extending
  {{{/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/toolchain/DefaultToolchain.html}<<<org.apache.maven.toolchain.DefaultToolchain>>>}}
  is strongly encouraged, since its provides
  {{{/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/toolchain/ToolchainPrivate.html}<<<org.apache.maven.toolchain.ToolchainPrivate>>>}},
  which is an internal requirement,

  * a {{{/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/toolchain/ToolchainFactory.html}<<<org.apache.maven.toolchain.ToolchainFactory>>>}},
  provided as Plexus component: Plexus {{{http://plexus.codehaus.org/plexus-containers/plexus-component-annotations/}<<<@Component>>>}}
  annotation in the class is extracted by {{{http://plexus.codehaus.org/plexus-containers/plexus-component-metadata/}<<<plexus-component-metadata>>>}}
  plugin.

* Creating a Plugin Using a Toolchain

  To get a configured toolchain, a plugin uses
  {{{/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/toolchain/ToolchainManager.html}<<<ToolchainManager>>>}} API
  to get expected toolchain, then some tool in the toolchain:

+--------+
    @Component
    private ToolchainManager toolchainManager;

    @Parameter( defaultValue = "${session}", required = true, readonly = true )
    private MavenSession session;

    public void execute()
        throws MojoExecutionException
    {
        // get the custom toolchain
        CustomToolchain toolchain = (CustomToolchain) toolchainManager.getToolchainFromBuildContext( "custom", session );

        if ( toolchain == null )
        {
            throw new MojoExecutionException( "Could not find 'custom' toolchain: please check maven-toolchains-plugin configuration." );
        }

        getLog().info( "Found 'custom' toolchain in build context." );

        // get a tool from the toolchain
        String path = toolchain.findTool( "tool" );

        getLog().info( "Found expected tool named 'tool' at following location: " + path );
    }
+--------+

  This code uses {{{/plugin-tools/maven-plugin-plugin/examples/using-annotations.html}Maven Plugin Tool Java 5 Annotations}}.

* Using the Custom Toolchain and its Plugin

  The custom toolchain implementation needs to be shared between the toolchain-aware plugin and <<<maven-toolchains-plugin>>>:
  this is done using Maven extension:

  * if the toolchain is packaged with the plugin, this is done by declaring the plugin as extension:

+--------+
      <plugin>
        <groupId>...</groupId>
        <artifactId>...</artifactId>
        <version>...</version>
        <extensions>true</extensions><!-- to share the custom toolchain with maven-toolchains-plugin -->
      </plugin>
+--------+

  * if the toolchain is packaged separately, to be shared by multiple plugins, it has to be declared as a build extension:

+--------+
<project>
  <build>
    <extensions>
      <extension>
        <groupId>...</groupId>
        <artifactId>...</artifactId>
        <version>...</version>
      </extension>
    </extensions>
  </build>
</project>
+--------+

  []

  Notice that packaging a toolchain in its own artifact separate from plugin is only useful when there are multiple plugins
  using the toolchain. As it is expected in general that a custom toolchain will be used by only one plugin
  (eventually providing multiple goals), it is simpler to package the toolchain with the plugin in only one artifact.
