Using File Name Mapping

 It might be necessary to customize the file name of libraries and TLDs. By default, those resources are stored
 using the following pattern:

+-----
@{artifactId}@-@{version}@.@{extension}@
+-----

 If the artifact has a classifier it is of course:

+-----
@{artifactId}@-@{version}@-@{classifier}@.@{extension}@
+-----

 The <<<outputFileNameMapping>>> parameter allows you to give a custom pattern. Each token defined in the
 pattern will be replaced with the value for the current artifact. You can use any property of Artifact and
 ArtifactHandler as a token.

 For instance, to store the libraries and TLDs without version numbers, use the following pattern:

+-----
@{artifactId}@.@{extension}@
+-----
