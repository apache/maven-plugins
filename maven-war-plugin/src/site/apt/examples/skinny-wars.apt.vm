Creating Skinny WARs

 In a typical J2EE environment, a WAR is packaged within an EAR for deployment.  The
 WAR can contain all its dependent JARs in <<<WEB-INF/lib>>> but then the EAR can quickly grow
 very large if there are multiple WARs, due to the presence of duplicate JARs.  Instead
 the J2EE specification allows WARs to reference external JARs packaged within the EAR
 via the <<<Class-Path>>> setting in their <<<MANIFEST.MF>>>.

 The Maven EAR Plugin has direct support for creating skinny wars which simply
 means to {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-ear-plugin/examples/skinny-wars.html}configure the maven-ear-plugin}}
 accordingly.

 You need to change the EAR project's <<<pom.xml>>> to package those dependent JARs in the EAR.
 Notice that we package everything into a <<<lib/>>> directory within the EAR.  This is
 just my own personal preference to distinguish between J2EE modules (which will
 be packaged in the root of the EAR) and Java libraries (which are packaged in <<<lib/>>>).

+-----------------+
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-ear-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.9.1</version>
        <configuration>
          <defaultLibBundleDir>lib/</defaultLibBundleDir>
          <skinnyWars>true</skinnyWars>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
+-----------------+

 Now the painful part.  Your EAR project's <<<pom.xml>>> needs to list every dependency that the WAR has.
 This is because Maven assumes fat WARs and does not include transitive dependencies
 of WARs within the EAR.

+-----------------+
  ....
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.acme</groupId>
      <artifactId>shared-jar</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.acme</groupId>
      <artifactId>war1</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
      <type>war</type>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.acme</groupId>
      <artifactId>war2</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
      <type>war</type>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ...
+-----------------+

 Your EAR will contain something like this:

+-----------------+
 .
 |-- META-INF
 |   `-- application.xml
 |-- lib
 |   `-- shared-jar-1.0.0.jar
 |-- war1-1.0.0.war
 `-- war2-1.0.0.war
+-----------------+
