Pre-defined Descriptor Files

  As of version 2.2, there are now four predefined descriptor formats available
  for reuse, packaged within the Assembly Plugin, instead of the original three.
  Their descriptorIds are:

  * {{{#bin}bin}} - can be used for general assembly of binary packages.

  * {{{#jar-with-dependencies}jar-with-dependencies}} - can be used for general
  assembly of a binary package with all the dependency libraries included
  unpacked inside the archive.

  * {{{#src}src}} - can be used for general assembly of a source archive which can
  be used to build your project.

  * {{{#project}project}} - <<new in version 2.2>>, this is used to create an
  assembly of the entire source project, including the Maven POM and other files
  outside of your source directory structure, but excluding all SCM files and
  the target directory. <<GOTCHA:>> If you use an output directory other than
  /target, this descriptorRef may include the output from your build process.

* {bin}

  Use <<<bin>>> as the <<<descriptorRef>>> of your assembly-plugin configuration
  in order to create a binary distribution archive of your project.
  This built-in descriptor produces an assembly with the classifier <<<bin>>>
  in three archive formats: tar.gz, tar.bz2, and zip.

  The assembled archive contains the binary jar produced by running
  <<<mvn package>>> plus any README, LICENSE, and NOTICE files available in the
  project root directory.

  Below is the <<<bin>>> descriptor format:

%{snippet|id=bin|url=${project.scm.url}/src/main/resources/assemblies/bin.xml}

* {jar-with-dependencies}

  Use <<<jar-with-dependencies>>> as the <<<descriptorRef>>> of your
  assembly-plugin configuration in order to create a jar archive which contains
  the binary output of your project, along its the unpacked dependencies.
  This built-in descriptor produces an assembly with the classifier
  <<<jar-with-dependencies>>> using the jar archive format.

  Below is the <<<jar-with-dependencies>>> descriptor format:

%{snippet|id=jar-with-dependencies|url=${project.scm.url}/src/main/resources/assemblies/jar-with-dependencies.xml}

* {src}

  Use <<<src>>> as the <<<descriptorRef>>> in your assembly-plugin configuration
  to create source archives for your project.  The archive will contain the
  contents of your project's <<</src>>> directory structure, for referency by
  your users. The <<<src>>> descriptorId produces an assembly archive with the
  classifier <<<src>>> in three formats: tar.gz, tar.bz2, and zip.

  Below is the <<<src>>> descriptor format:

%{snippet|id=src|url=${project.scm.url}/src/main/resources/assemblies/src.xml}

* {project}

  Using the <<<project>>> <<<\<descriptorRef\>>>> in your assembly plugin
  configuration will produce an assembly containing your entire project, minus
  any build output that lands in the <<</target>>> directory. The resulting
  assembly should allow your users to build your project using Maven, Ant, or
  whatever build system you have configured in your project's normal SCM working
  directory. It produces assemblies with the classifier <<<project>>> in
  three archive formats: tar.gz, tar.bz2, and zip.

  The following is the assembly descriptor for the <<<project>>> descriptorRef:

%{snippet|id=project|url=${project.scm.url}/src/main/resources/assemblies/project.xml}
