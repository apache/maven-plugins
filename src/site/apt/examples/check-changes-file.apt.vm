Check Your changes.xml File

  Since version 2.4 this plugin has a {{{../changes-check-mojo.html}goal}} that
  checks that your <<<changes.xml>>> file has a valid release date.

  You can attach this goal to the <<<release>>> phase if you want the check to
  be performed automatically when you release the project.

* Configuring the Plugin

  Configure the plugin like this to tell it to check your <<<changes.xml>>>
  file.
