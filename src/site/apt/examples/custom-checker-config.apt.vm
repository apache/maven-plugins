Using a Custom Checkstyle Checker Configuration

  A custom {{{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config.html#Checker}Checker configuration xml file}} can
  be defined and then referenced via a URL, File, or build classpath resource reference.

  To reference a custom Checkstyle Checker configuration, use the <<<configLocation>>> parameter.

<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <configLocation>checkstyle.xml</configLocation>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

  This example causes the Checkstyle Plugin to check for a File named <<<checkstyle.xml>>> or a
  resource named <<<checkstyle.xml>>> within the compile scope of the dependencies or build extensions
  classpath.

  There are 2 predefined Checkstyle configuration definitions that ship with the Checkstyle Plugin,
  the Sun Microsystems Definition is selected by default.

  * <<sun_checks.xml>> - Sun Microsystems Definition (default).

  * <<google_checks.xml>> - Google Definition.
