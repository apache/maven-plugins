Eclipse and Maven Integration

  This page describes how to integrate an EAR project in Eclipse or Eclipse-based IDE <<without>> M2Eclipse support.
  
  If you have used <<<mvn eclipse:eclipse>>> to generate the metadata for an EAR project, it will want the <<<application.xml>>> file in the <<<src/main/application/META-INF>>> directory. 

  If you edit <<<application.xml>>> using the WTP based Application Deployment Descriptor editor, it will use the name of the projects (Web, EJB etc) as the name of the modules. Here is an example:

+------------------------+
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<application xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/application_1_4.xsd" version="1.4">
  <display-name>FireDragon</display-name>
  <module>
    <web>
      <web-uri>FireDragonWeb.war</web-uri>
      <context-root>firedragon</context-root>
    </web>
  </module>
</application>
+------------------------+

  Obviously this does not have the typical Maven based version naming convention applied to it. This allows us to run the application internally within eclipse/rsa using the test environments.
  When Maven is used to create the ear using <<<mvn package>>>, it will create the versionized <<<application.xml>>> file, if told to. 
  However, by default it will not pick up the generated (versionized) one, it will use the existing one in the <<<src/main/application/META-INF>>> directory.

  The solution to resolve this conflict is to have Maven generate the <<<application.xml>>> and use the generated one as opposed to the existing one.

  This can be achieved via these two directives:

+------------------------+
  <generateApplicationXml>true</generateApplicationXml>
  <applicationXml>\${project.build.directory}/application.xml</applicationXml>
+------------------------+

  The first line tells Maven to generate a new <<<application.xml>>> file, by default in the target directory.
  The second line tells Maven to use it.
