Specifying a character encoding scheme

 A character encoding scheme such as <<<ASCII>>>, <<<UTF-8>>> or <<<UTF-16>>> can be chosen to be
 used for the reading and writing of files.

 The best practice is to {{{https://maven.apache.org/general.html#encoding-warning}define encoding}}
 for copying filtered resources via the property <<<$\{project.build.sourceEncoding}>>> which should be
 defined in the pom properties section like this:
 
+-----+
<project ...>
 ...
 <properties>
   <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
   ...
 </properties>
 ..
</project>
+-----+

 By using the above property <<<maven-resources-plugin>>> will automatically
 use this {{{../resources-mojo.html#encoding}encoding}}.
 
 Occasionally you need to change the encoding explicitly for different purposes.
 This can be done by defining the encoding via the configuration
 like this: 
 
+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-resources-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          ...
          <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
          ...
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+
