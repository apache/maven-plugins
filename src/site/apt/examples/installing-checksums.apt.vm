Creating artifact checksums

  The Install Plugin can create integrity checksums (MD5, SHA-1)
  for the artifacts during installation. Checksums are cryptographic hash
  functions and are used to check the integrity of the associated file. This can be
  activated by setting the <<<createChecksum>>> parameter to <<<true>>>.

  In the <<<install:install>>> goal.

+---+
mvn install -DcreateChecksum=true
+---+


  In the <<<install:install-file>>> goal.

+---+
mvn ${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:${project.version}:install-file  -Dfile=path-to-your-artifact-jar \
                                                                              -DgroupId=your.groupId \
                                                                              -DartifactId=your-artifactId \
                                                                              -Dversion=version \
                                                                              -Dpackaging=jar \
                                                                              -DcreateChecksum=true

  <<Note>>: By using the fully qualified path of a goal, you're ensured to be using the preferred version of the maven-install-plugin. When using <<<mvn install:install-file>>> 
  its version depends on its specification in the pom or the version of Apache Maven.
