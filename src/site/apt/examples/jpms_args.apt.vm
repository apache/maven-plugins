JPMS.ARGS

  Java 9 comes with a new set of arguments related to the Java Platform Modular System. Besides the module path are
  other new arguments which can change the behavior of the application. These can be used during both compile time
  and runtime. This information is not stored in any class, but it can be interesting to know at runtime which extra
  arguments were used at compile time.
  
  If any of these arguments is used, the <<<META-INF/jpms.args>>> is created.
  Every argument gets its own line.
  The following arguments will end up in this file:
  
  * <<<--upgrade-module-path>>>
  
  * <<<--add-exports>>>
  
  * <<<--add-reads>>>
  
  * <<<--add-modules>>>
  
  * <<<--limit-modules>>>
  
  * <<<--patch-module>>>
  
  []
  
  The <<<--patch-module>>> values are different compared to the original values passed to the compiler. Occording to
  the specification it looks like <<<--patch-module \<module\>=\<file\>(\<pathsep\>\<file\>)\*>>>
  However, files are system specific. For that reason the module names are used. If the jar itself contains the 
  patchcode, then an <<<_>>> (underscore) is used. As separators a <<<, >>> (comma + space) is used.
