Analyzing JSP Code

  The PMD plugin analyzes Java by default. You can configure it to analyze Java Server Pages files instead as shown below.

  The example assumes that the JSP source code is stored in various subdirectories under the source directory
  <<<src/main/webapp>>> and enables the built-in JSP ruleset (<basic>).

 Note that you have to make sure that you configure <<<compileSourceRoots>>> and <<<includes>>>, so that
 PMD finds the JSP files.
