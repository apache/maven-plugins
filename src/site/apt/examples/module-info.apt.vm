Older projects with module-info

  For projects that want to be compatible with older versions of Java (i.e 1.8 or below), but also want to provide a
  <<<module-info.java>>> for Java 9 projects must be aware that they need to call <<<javac>>> twice: the 
  <<<module-info.java>>> must be compiled with <<<release=9>>>, while the rest of the sources must be compiled with a
  lower version of <<<source>>>/<<<target>>>.

  The preferred way to do this is by having 2 execution blocks are described below. JDK 9 only supports compilations for 
  Java 6 and above, so projects wanting to be compatible with Java 5 or below need to use two different JDKs. With 
  {{{/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html}toolchains}} it is quite easy to achieve this. Be aware that you will
  need at least Maven 3.3.1 to specify a custom jdkToolchain in your plugin configuration. You could add a jdkToolchain
  to do base-compile execution-block as well referring to JDK 5.

+-------

  In case you want the project to be Java 6 compatible, the easiest to do this is to use Java 9 for both execution
  blocks. You can use the maven-toolchain-plugin to specify the shared JDK (supported since Maven 2.0.9) or a custom 
  jdkToolchain (supported since Maven 3.3.1) and refer to the JDK 9 installation on your system. Or simply use Java 9
  as the runtime for Maven by setting <<<JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-9>>>.
