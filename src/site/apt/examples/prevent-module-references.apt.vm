Prevent Project References

  By default, the Eclipse Plugin will create sub-projects for dependencies that
  exists in the reactor.  If you don't want to work with the development code
  and prefer to use the deployed packages, you can still do so by disabling the
  project references like so:

+-----
mvn eclipse:eclipse -Declipse.useProjectReferences=false
+-----

  or in your pom.xml:

+-----
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    [...]
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-eclipse-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <useProjectReferences>false</useProjectReferences>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      [...]
    </plugins>
    [...]
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
