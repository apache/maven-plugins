Provide Project Natures And Build Commands for Eclipse

  The default project nature for projects created by the Eclipse Plugin is
  <<<org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature>>> and the default build command is
  <<<org.eclipse.jdt.core.javabuilder>>>. Additional project natures and build
  commands are also added as needed when WTP is enabled.

  If you want to provide additional project natures and build commands for your
  project, i.e. Spring project, you can add them in your pom.xml like this:

+-----
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    [...]
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-eclipse-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <additionalProjectnatures>
            <projectnature>org.springframework.ide.eclipse.core.springnature</projectnature>
          </additionalProjectnatures>
          <additionalBuildcommands>
            <buildcommand>org.springframework.ide.eclipse.core.springbuilder</buildcommand>
          </additionalBuildcommands>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      [...]
    </plugins>
    [...]
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+-----

  To provide your own project natures and build commands which will override
  the defaults, you can put them in your pom.xml as follows:

+-----
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    [...]
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-eclipse-plugin<artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <projectnatures>
            <projectnature>my.own.project.nature</projectnature>
          </projectnatures>
          <buildcommands>
            <buildcommand>my.own.build.command</buildcommand>
          </buildcommands>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      [...]
    </plugins>
    [...]
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+-----
