Remove Report

 You may want to generate only one of the reports, but not the other.  To do
 this you can use the <<<\<reportSets\>>>> feature within your POM.  Below is
 the default configuration for the plugin.  To disable one of the reports,
 just copy the <<<\<reportSets\>>>> element below to your POM and remove the
 <<<\<report\>>>> you don't want to generate.
