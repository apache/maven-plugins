Using Perforce

  The maven-changelog-plugin uses {{{http://maven.apache.org/scm/}Maven SCM}}
  as an underlying layer, when accessing your SCM system. When Maven SCM is
  working with Perforce it needs a clientspec. This is provided by setting
  system properties that are then read by Maven SCM.

  Configuring this is done in the same way as for the maven-scm-plugin. So if
  you have a working configuration for maven-scm-plugin, you can just copy
  those lines over to your maven-changelog-plugin configuration. The following
  configuration shows an example of what this can look like.

<project>

  <reporting>

      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-changelog-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <systemProperties>
            <property>
              <name>maven.scm.perforce.clientspec.name</name>
              <value>your.perforce.clientspec.name</value>
            </property>
          </systemProperties>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
