Integrated DOAP Plugin With The Site Plugin

 As described in {{{./doap-in-use.html}DOAP In Use}}, you need to publish the generated DOAP file.

 By default, the generated DOAP file will be deploy using the
 <<<{{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/usage.html}site:deploy}}>>> goal in the site specified in
 the <distributionManagement> section of the POM.

* Including DOAP In The Site Phase

 You could always generate the DOAP file for your project by sticking the DOAP Plugin in the <<<site>>> phase, like the following:

+-----+
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-doap-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>site</id>
            <phase>site</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>generate</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
+-----+

* Defining Meta Tag

 To make the DOAP file available for all HTML files deployed on the site, you could modify the <<<src/site/site.xml>>>
 to specify a \<link/\> tag, i.e.:

+-----+
<project>
  <body>
    <head>
      <link rel="meta" title="DOAP" href="\${project.url}/doap_\${project.artifactId}.rdf" type="application/rdf+xml"/>
    </head>
    ...
  </body>
</project>
+-----+
