Maven WAR Plugin

 The war plugin is responsible for collecting all artifact dependencies, classes
 and resources of the web application and packaging them into a web application archive.
 
* Goals Overview

 * {{{war-mojo.html}war:war}} is the default goal invoked during the package phase for projects with a package type of war.
 
 * {{{exploded-mojo.html}war:exploded}} is generally used to speed up testing during the developement phase by creating
 an exploded war in a specified directory.    
 
 * {{{inplace-mojo.html}war:inplace}} another variation of the war:explode where the war is instead generated in the web source directory
 which is <<<src/main/webapp>>> by default.
 
* Usage

  Instructions on how to use the Maven WAR Plugin can be found {{{usage.html}here}}.
