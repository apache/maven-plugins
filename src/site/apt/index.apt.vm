${project.name}

 The Site Plugin is used to generate a site for the project. The generated site also includes the project's reports
 that were configured in the POM.

 This is the site for <<version 3>> of the maven-site-plugin. It requires at least Maven ${prerequisiteMavenVersion} to run. If you
 are looking for <<version 2>> you can find it {{{/plugins/maven-site-plugin-2.x/index.html}here}}.

 Please read the {{{./migrate.html}migration guide}} if you want to upgrade from a previous version.

* Goals Overview

   The Site Plugin has seven goals:

   * {{{./site-mojo.html}site:site}} is used generate a site for a single project.
     Note that links between module sites in a multi module build will <<not>> work, since local build directory structure
     doesn't match deployed site.

   * {{{./deploy-mojo.html}site:deploy}} is used to deploy the generated site using Wagon supported protocol to
     the site URL specified in the <<<\<distributionManagement\>>>> section of the POM.

   * {{{./run-mojo.html}site:run}} starts the site up, rendering documents as requested for faster editing. It uses Jetty
     as the web server.

   * {{{./stage-mojo.html}site:stage}} generates a site in a local staging or mock directory based on the site URL
     specified in the <<<\<distributionManagement\>>>> section of the POM. It can be used
     to test that links between module sites in a multi module build work. This goal requires the site to already have been
     generated using the site goal, such as by calling <<<mvn site>>>.

   * {{{./stage-deploy-mojo.html}site:stage-deploy}} deploys the generated site to a staging or mock directory to the site
     URL specified in the <<<\<distributionManagement\>>>> section of the POM.

   * {{{./attach-descriptor-mojo.html}site:attach-descriptor}} adds the site descriptor (<<<site.xml>>>) to the list of
     files to be installed/deployed. For more references of the site descriptor,
     {{{./examples/sitedescriptor.html}here's a link}}.

   * {{{./jar-mojo.html}site:jar}} bundles the site output into a JAR so that it can be deployed to a repository.

   * {{{./effective-site-mojo.html}site:effective-site}} calculates the effective site descriptor, after inheritance and
     interpolation.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Site Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
