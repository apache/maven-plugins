Maven Checkstyle Plugin

  The Checkstyle Plugin generates a report regarding the code style used by the developers. For more information about Checkstyle,
  see {{{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/}http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/}}.
  This version of the plugin uses Checkstyle ${checkstyleVersion}.

  The plugin can be configured in the project's POM. Predefined rulesets are included with the plugin, these are:
  <<<sun_checks.xml>>>, <<<turbine_checks.xml>>>, <<<avalon_checks.xml>>> and <<<maven_checks.xml>>>. You can also use a custom ruleset by
  specifying it in the plugin configuration.

* Goals Overview

   The Checkstyle Plugin has two goals:

   * {{{./checkstyle-mojo.html}checkstyle:checkstyle}} performs Checkstyle analysis and generates a report on violations.

   * {{{./checkstyle-aggregate-mojo.html}checkstyle:checkstyle-aggregate}} performs Checkstyle analysis and generates a
     report on violations, aggregating the result in the project which started this mojo.

   * {{{./check-mojo.html}checkstyle:check}} performs a violation check against the last Checkstyle run to see if there are
     any violations. It reads the Checkstyle output file, counts the number of violations found and displays it on the
     console.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Checkstyle Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the
  {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Checkstyle+Plugin}plugin's wiki page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.

* Examples

   The following examples show how to use the Checkstyle Plugin in more advanced usecases:

   * {{{./examples/custom-checker-config.html}Using a Custom Checkstyle Checker Configuration}}

   * {{{./examples/custom-property-expansion.html}Using Custom Checkstyle Property Expansion Definitions}}

   * {{{./examples/suppressions-filter.html}Using a Suppressions Filter}}

   * {{{./examples/custom-developed-checkstyle.html}Using Custom Developed Checkstyle Check Modules}}
