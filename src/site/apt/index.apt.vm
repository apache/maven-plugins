  specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the

  free to contact the {{{mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching

  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
