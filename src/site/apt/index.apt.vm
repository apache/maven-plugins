${project.name}

  The dependency plugin provides the capability to manipulate artifacts. It
  can copy and/or unpack artifacts from local or remote repositories to a
  specified location.

* Goals Overview

  The Dependency plugin has several goals:

  *{{{./analyze-mojo.html}dependency:analyze}} analyzes the dependencies of this project and determines which are: used
  and declared; used and undeclared; unused and declared.

  *{{{./analyze-dep-mgt-mojo.html}dependency:analyze-dep-mgt}} analyzes your projects dependencies and lists mismatches
  between resolved dependencies and those listed in your dependencyManagement section.

  *{{{./analyze-only-mojo.html}dependency:analyze-only}} is the same as analyze, but is meant to be bound in a pom. It
  does not fork the build and execute test-compile.

  *{{{./analyze-report-mojo.html}dependency:analyze-report}} analyzes the dependencies of this project and produces a report
  that summarises which are: used and declared; used and undeclared; unused and declared.

  *{{{./analyze-duplicate-mojo.html}dependency:analyze-duplicate}} analyzes the <<<\<dependencies/\>>>> and <<<\<dependencyManagement/\>>>>
  tags in the pom.xml and determines the duplicate declared dependencies.

  *{{{./build-classpath-mojo.html}dependency:build-classpath}} tells
  Maven to output the path of the dependencies from the local repository in a classpath format to be used in java -cp.
  The classpath file may also be attached and installed/deployed along with the main artifact.

  *{{{./copy-mojo.html}dependency:copy}} takes a list of artifacts defined in the plugin configuration section and
  copies them to a specified location, renaming them or stripping the version if desired. This goal can resolve
  the artifacts from remote repositories if they don't exist in either the local repository or the reactor.

  *{{{./copy-dependencies-mojo.html}dependency:copy-dependencies}} takes the list of project direct dependencies and
  optionally transitive dependencies and copies them to a specified location, stripping the version if desired.
  This goal can also be run from the command line.

  *{{{./display-ancestors-mojo.html}dependency:display-ancestors}} displays all ancestor POMs of the project. 
  This may be useful in a continuous integration system where you want to know all parent poms of the project.
  This goal can also be run from the command line.

  *{{{./get-mojo.html}dependency:get}} resolves a single artifact, eventually transitively, from a specified remote repository.

  *{{{./go-offline-mojo.html}dependency:go-offline}} tells Maven to resolve everything this project is dependent on
  (dependencies, plugins, reports) in preparation for going offline.

  *{{{./list-mojo.html}dependency:list}} alias for resolve that lists the dependencies for this project.

  *{{{./list-repositories-mojo.html}dependency:list-repositories}} displays all project dependencies and then lists the repositories used.

  *{{{./properties-mojo.html}dependency:properties}} set a property for each project dependency containing the
  to the artifact on the file system.

  *{{{./purge-local-repository-mojo.html}dependency:purge-local-repository}} tells Maven to clear dependency artifact
  files out of the local repository, and optionally re-resolve them.

  *{{{./resolve-mojo.html}dependency:resolve}} tells Maven to resolve all dependencies and displays the version. <<JAVA 9 NOTE:>> <will display the
  module name when running with Java 9.>

  *{{{./resolve-plugins-mojo.html}dependency:resolve-plugins}} tells Maven to resolve plugins and their dependencies.

  *{{{./sources-mojo.html}dependency:sources}} tells Maven to resolve all dependencies and their source attachments,
  and displays the version.

  *{{{./tree-mojo.html}dependency:tree}} displays the dependency tree for this project.

  *{{{./unpack-mojo.html}dependency:unpack}} like copy but unpacks.

  *{{{./unpack-dependencies-mojo.html}dependency:unpack-dependencies}} like
  copy-dependencies but unpacks.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Dependency Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
