Introduction

 This plugin runs the junit tests in an isolated classloader.  By default, this plugin will be executed in 
 "test" phase of m2 lifecycle.  

 This plugin generates 2 types of report, Text File Report and XML File Report. Both files will be generated in the
 <<<${basedir}/target/surefire-report>>>.  For an HTML version of the report, please see the Maven Surefire Report Plugin.
