Using it with Maven 3

  A major aim of the refactoring in Maven 3 was to decouple the Maven core from Doxia
  and to allow arbitrary reporting systems to be developed. For this reason, all reporting
  related code has been removed from the core of Maven 3
  ({{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-4162}MNG-4162}}).

  As a result, the 2.x versions of the Maven Site Plugin will not work with Maven 3.
  Using such versions of Maven Site Plugin with Maven 3 won't generate any reports from reporting plugin,
  only hand-written Doxia documents (apt, xdoc, ...) will be rendered.

  You need to use version 3.x of the Site Plugin, in order for it to work with Maven 3.

* Plugins Compatibility Matrix for Maven 3

** Plugins Maintained by the Apache Maven Community

  Tests have been made on the reporting profile of the Maven parent POM which enables some reports.
  You will need so update some of these plugins for them to work with Maven 3. Below you will find the minimum version
  required for these plugins to work in Maven 3.

*-----------------------------------+-----------+
| <<Plugin>>                        |<<Version>>|
*-----------------------------------+-----------+
| maven-changelog-plugin            | 2.1       |
*-----------------------------------+-----------+
| maven-changes-plugin              | 2.1       |
*-----------------------------------+-----------+
| maven-checkstyle-plugin           | 2.5       |

* Configuration formats

  The <<<\<reporting\>>>> section of the POM has been moved to the Site Plugin's configuration in Maven 3.
  The content of the configuration has been kept as similar as possible to Maven 2.
  The <<<{{{/shared/maven-reporting-exec/}maven-reporting-exec}}>>> component transforms the configuration on the fly.

** Old configuration (Maven 2 & 3)

  Reports are configured in the <<<\<reporting\>>>> section of the POM.

+-----+
  <reporting>
    <excludeDefaults>true</excludeDefaults>
    <outputDirectory></outputDirectory>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-project-info-reports-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.4</version>
        <configuration>
          <dependencyDetailsEnabled>false</dependencyDetailsEnabled>
          <dependencyLocationsEnabled>false</dependencyLocationsEnabled>
        </configuration>
        <reportSets>
          <reportSet>
            <reports>
              <report>dependencies</report>
              <report>scm</report>
            </reports>
          </reportSet>
        </reportSets>
      </plugin>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.8</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
+-----+

** New Configuration (Maven 3 only, no reports configuration inheritance)

  Reports are configured in the configuration for <<<maven-site-plugin>>> as <<<\<reportPlugins\>>>> elements.

+-----+
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          ...
          <reportPlugins>
            <plugin>
              <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
              <artifactId>maven-project-info-reports-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>2.4</version>
              <configuration>
                <dependencyDetailsEnabled>false</dependencyDetailsEnabled>
                <dependencyLocationsEnabled>false</dependencyLocationsEnabled>
              </configuration>
              <!-- simpler configuration without reportSets available for usual cases -->
              <reports>
                <report>dependencies</report>
                <report>scm</report>
              </reports>
            </plugin>
            <plugin>
              <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
              <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>2.8</version>
            </plugin>
          </reportPlugins>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
+-----+

  <<Note:>> In Maven 3, the new format does not support report plugins configuration inheritance: see
  {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSITE-484}MSITE-484}}. This format was technically necessary to remove reporting logic
  from Maven 3, but a new inheritance mechanism still needs to be added to Maven 3 to make it as flexible as the old format.
  So the new format is not ready for direct use for now.

* Version Resolution

  When used with Maven 3, a report plugin version can be empty.
  The following order/strategy will be used to find/resolve a version:

  * search the same groupId/artifactId in the build.plugins section

  * search the same groupId/artifactId in the build.pluginManagement.plugins section

  * resolve with current repositories (can include automatic SNAPSHOT resolution)

* Site descriptor attachment

  In Maven 3, the default execution of <<<site:attach-descriptor>>> has been removed from the
  built-in lifecycle bindings for projects with packaging "pom". Users that actually use those
  projects to provide a common site descriptor for sub modules will need to explicitly define
  the following goal execution to restore the intended behavior:

+-----+
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>attach-descriptor</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>attach-descriptor</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
+-----+

* Using the same version of maven-site-plugin for both Maven 2 and Maven 3

  Starting with version 3.0, maven-site-plugin can run with both Maven 2.2.x and 3.x. The
  results should be exactly the same if reports are configured in the old Maven 2 way, in the <<<\<reporting\>>>>
  section. If you use the new Maven 3 way of configuring reports, in the <<<\<reportPlugins\>>>> section, it will only
  work with Maven 3.

  The following snippet automatically activates <<<site:attach-descriptor>>> when run with Maven 3:

+-----+
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>maven-3</id>
      <activation>
        <file>
          <!--  This employs that the basedir expression is only recognized by Maven 3.x (see MNG-2363) -->
          <exists>${basedir}</exists>
        </file>
      </activation>
      <build>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
            <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
            <executions>
              <execution>
                <id>attach-descriptor</id>
                <goals>
                  <goal>attach-descriptor</goal>
                </goals>
              </execution>
            </executions>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
+-----+

  <<Note:>> The profile is needed to avoid duplicate install and deploy of the site descriptor when running with Maven 2.2.x due to POM default lifecycle mappings.

* Using maven-site-plugin 2.x with Maven 2 and maven-site-plugin 3.x with Maven 3

  Before maven-site-plugin 3.0, maven-site-plugin 2.x was compatible only with Maven 2 and maven-site-plugin
  3.0-betas were compatible only with Maven 3. A trick is needed to let Maven 2 use one version of the plugin and Maven 3
  another version in the same <<<pom.xml>>>.

  The following snippet automatically activates maven-site-plugin 3.x when run with Maven 3:

+-----+
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>maven-3</id>
      <activation>
        <file>
          <!--  This employs that the basedir expression is only recognized by Maven 3.x (see MNG-2363) -->
          <exists>${basedir}</exists>
        </file>
      </activation>
      <build>
        <pluginManagement>
          <plugins>
            <plugin>
              <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
              <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>${project.version}</version>
            </plugin>
          </plugins>
        </pluginManagement>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
            <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
            <executions>
              <execution>
                <id>attach-descriptor</id>
                <goals>
                  <goal>attach-descriptor</goal>
                </goals>
              </execution>
            </executions>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
+-----+

  <<Note:>> Be aware that you should also use <<<\<pluginManagement\>>>> to specify the version for maven-site-plugin 2.x.
  If you define the plugin version directly inside the <<<\<plugins\>>>> section of the <<<\<build\>>>> element
  then that version is always used, no matter which version of Maven is used. That snippet would look like this:

+-----+
  <build>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>2.3</version>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
  </build>
+-----+
