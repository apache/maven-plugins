Toolchain Identification

 The toolchain type id is "jdk".
 
 Predefined identification tokens are:

    * "version" marks the version of the jdk. Plugin can match against a single version or any version ranges.

    * any other tokens will be accepted, but only exact matches are supported.

Toolchain Configuration

 There is only one configuration element named "jdkHome". It designates the root directory 
of JDK installation.


Sample toolchains.xml Setup

+---+
<toolchains>
    <toolchain>
       <type>jdk</type>
       <provides>
           <version>1.5</version>
           <vendor>sun</vendor>
           <id>for_mevenide</id>
       </provides>
       <configuration>
          <jdkHome>/home/mkleint/javatools/jdk</jdkHome>
       </configuration>
    </toolchain>
  [...]
</toolchains>
+---+


Plugin Configuration     

 For selection of toolchain for use by the project the following conditions are matched
against the definitions in the toolchains.xml file.

    * "version" which accepts any {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-enforcer-plugin/rules/versionRanges.html}version range definitions}}.
 Version declared by the toolchain needs to fit into the range.
            
    * any other tokens needs exact match. Toolchain not providing such token will not be selected.

 All conditions need to be satisfied in a sucessfully matched toolchain.
