* Sign artifacts with GnuPG

  Signs all of a project's attached artifacts with GnuPG.

  You need to have previously configured the default key.

  <<<gpg>>> also needs to be on the search path.

  First you add the plugin to your <<<pom.xml>>> like this:

+----------+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-gpg-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>sign-artifacts</id>
            <phase>verify</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>sign</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+----------+

  Then you specify the passphrase on the command line. Like this:

+----------+
mvn verify -Dgpg.passphrase=thephrase
+----------+

  If you don't specify a passphrase, it will prompt for one.

  <<Note:>> When using the GPG Plugin in combination with the Maven Release Plugin, you might need to specify the passphrase
  like this:

+----------+
mvn release:perform -Darguments=-Dgpg.passphrase=thephrase
+----------+

  This accounts for the fact, that the Release Plugin forks Maven and system properties of the current Maven session are
  unfortunately not automatically propagated to the forked Maven session (see also {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MGPG-9}MGPG-9}}).
