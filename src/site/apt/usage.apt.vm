Usage

 The maven-scm-publish-plugin submits modified content to SCM, sites being the most classical case.
 There are two ways you can set this up for site in your POM.

* Use the Custom Lifecycle

  Unfortunately, a Maven plugin can't define a top-level lifecycle
  like 'site'. However, it can come close. The plugin includes the 
  <scmpublish> goal. This goal does nothing except fork a custom
  <scmpublish> lifecycle, consisting of the following phases:

  * <<<scmpublish-prepare>>>

  * <<<scmpublish-pre-site>>>

  * <<<scmpublish-site>>>

  * <<<scmpublish-post-site>>>

  * <<<scmpublish-publish>>>

  []

  (Again unfortunately, Maven does not allow a custom lifecycle to share
  phases with some other lifecycle.)

  With a little configuration in your POM, 

+---------+
  mvn scm-publish:scmpublish
+---------+

  will do all the work.   

+------+
  <build>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-scm-publish-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>@pom.version@</version>
          <extensions>true</extensions>
          <configuration>
            <!-- svn location for publication -->                  
            <pubScmUrl>scm:svn:https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/sandbox/bimargulies/site-test-003</pubScmUrl>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
  </build>
+------+

  <Notice>: this is actually not working, the 003-lifecycle IT has been disabled.

* Using the Site Lifecycle

   The alternative is to attach the necessary activities to the site lifecycle and deactivate
   maven-site-plugin's site deploy goal. This requires more XML in the POM, but it may be easier
   to use if you already customize the site lifecycle for other reasons.
