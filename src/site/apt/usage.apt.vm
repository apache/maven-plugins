Using The PDF Plugin

  The Maven PDF Plugin allows you generate a PDF document of your documentation.

* From The Command-line

  The PDF plugin can be called to execute from the command-line without any
  additional configurations.  Like the other plugins, to run the PDF plugin,
  you use:

+-----
  mvn pdf:pdf
+-----

  where the first <<<pdf>>> refers to the plugin's alias, and the second
  <<<pdf>>> refers to a plugin goal.

  By default, the pdf will be generated in <<<target/pdf/>>> directory.

  <<Notes>>:

  [[1]] By default, the PDF plugin generates a PDF document which aggregates all your site documents.
  If you want to generate each site document individually, you need to add <<<-Daggregate=false>>> in the command line.

  [[2]] By default, the PDF plugin uses the {{{http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/}FOP}} implementation.
  The plugin also supports the {{{http://www.lowagie.com/iText/}iText}} implementation, you just need to add
  <<<-Dimplementation=itext>>> in the command line.

  []

* {As Part Of Your Build Process}

  The PDF plugin can be put into a project's pom.xml so that it gets executed
  everytime the project is built.  Below is a sample configuration
  (to put into the list of <<<\<plugins\>>>> in the <<<\<build\>>>>
  section of your <<<pom.xml>>>) for running the
  PDF plugin in the <<<site>>> phase everytime the project is built:

%{snippet|id=configuration|file=pom.xml}

  <<Note>>: In this case, the pdf plugin is coupled with the Maven Site plugin to generate both site documentation
  and pdfs into the default output site directory, i.e. <<<target/site>>>. You just need to call <<<mvn site>>>.

* Document Descriptor

  By default, the pdf plugin processes all source files as specified
  in the site-plugins's <<<site.xml>>>. You can customize
  which files to include in which order by using a document descriptor
  (by default <<<src/site/pdf.xml>>>). An example is given below:

%{snippet|id=docDescriptor|file=src/site/pdf.xml}

  The <<<meta>>> information is only used for the pdf cover page if
  no <<<cover>>> element is given. The <<<toc>>> generates a Table
  of Contents and specifies the order of files to include in the pdf.
  For a complete description of the file format, see the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/doxia/doxia/doxia-core/document.html}Document Model Reference}}.

  <<Notes>>:

  [[1]] Only a few of document metadatas are used by the Fo/iText sinks like author, confidential, date and title.

  [[2]] The document descriptor supports filtering as described in the
  {{{./examples/filtering.html}filtering example}}.

  []

* Internationalization

  The PDF plugin is able to generate internationalized pdfs, similar to the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html}site creation}}.

  To enable multiple locales, add a configuration similar to the following to your POM:

+-----
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-pdf-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <locales>en,fr</locales>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----

  This will generate two pdfs, one English and one French. Like the site plugin, if <<<en>>> is your
  current locale, then it will be generated at the root of the site, with a copy of the French translation of the
  site in the <<<fr/>>> subdirectory.

  The following is a complete internationalized directory layout for site and pdf plugins:

+-----
+- src/
   +- site/
      +- apt/
      |  +- index.apt     (Default version)
      |
      +- fr/
      |  +- apt/
      |     +- index.apt  (French version)
      |
      +- site.xml         (Default site descriptor)
      +- site_fr.xml      (French site descriptor)
      +- pdf.xml          (Default pdf descriptor)
      +- pdf_fr.xml       (French pdf descriptor)
+-----

* Specific FOP Configuration Properties

  All the layout properties that are used for the pdf conversion using the FOP implementation are read
  from a default configuration file. The properties in this file may be
  overridden by  using a custom configuration file <<<pdf-config.xml>>>
  located in <<<src/site/resources/>>>.

  The format of this file has to be exactly the same as the original
  {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/doxia/doxia/trunk/doxia-modules/doxia-module-fo/src/main/resources/fo-styles.xslt}default configuration file}}.
  However, you only need to specify the properties that you want to override,
  <e.g.> to change the font size of pre-formatted text, you could use:

%{snippet|id=foConfig|file=src/site/resources/pdf-config.xml}
