Usage

 Some brief examples on how to use this plugin. If you want to use advanced
 configurations you should have a look at the documentation for
 {{{http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-archiver/}Maven Archiver}}.

* How to build a jar file

  If the packaging of your project is set to 'jar', this plugin is executed
  whenever it passes the "package" phase. You can execute it
  using the command below:

+-----------------+
mvn package
+-----------------+

  In your project's <<<target>>> directory you'll able to see the generated jar file.


* How to sign a jar file

  If you need to sign your jar, you just need to configure
  the sign goal appropriately in your <<<pom.xml>>>, for the signing to occur
  automatically during the package phase.

  Note that you can automatically verify a jar after signing it.

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <packaging>jar</packaging>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>sign</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
        <configuration>
          <keystore>/path/to/your/keystore</keystore>
          <alias>youralias</alias>
          <storepass>yourstorepassword</storepass>
          <signedjar>\${project.build.directory}/signed/\${project.build.finalName}.jar</signedjar>
          <verify>true</verify>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+

  If you do not specify the <<<\<signedjar\>>>> file, your jar will be signed in-place.
  If you do specify it, the plugin will attempt to create the resulting containing directory.

* How to sign a jar file specifying parameters on the command line

+-----------------+
mvn jar:sign -Dkeystore=/path/to/your/keystore -Dstorepass=yourstorepassword -Dalias=youralias
+-----------------+

* How to verify a signed jar file specifying parameters on the command line

+-----------------+
mvn jar:sign-verify [-Djarpath=/path/to/your/signedjar] [-Dverbose=true [-Dcheckcerts=true] ]
+-----------------+

* How to disable jar signing

+-----------------+
mvn ... -Dmaven.jar.skip.sign=true
+-----------------+

* How to include/exclude content from jar artifact

  Specify a list of fileset patterns to be included or excluded by adding
  <<<\<includes\>>>>/<<<\<include\>>>> or <<<\<excludes\>>>>/<<<\<exclude\>>>>
  in your <<<pom.xml>>>.

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <includes>
            <include>**/service/*</include>
          </includes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+

  Note that the patterns need to be relative to the path specified for the plugin's
  <<<classesDirectory>>> parameter.

* How to create an additional attached jar artifact from the project

  Specify a list of fileset patterns to be included or excluded by adding
  <<<\<includes\>>>>/<<<\<include\>>>> or <<<\<excludes\>>>>/<<<\<exclude\>>>>
  and add a <<<classifier>>> in your <<<pom.xml>>>.

  <<Note:>> the jar-plugin must be defined in a new execution, otherwise it
  will replace the default use of the jar-plugin instead of adding a second
  artifact. The <<<classifier>>> is also required to create more than one artifact.
