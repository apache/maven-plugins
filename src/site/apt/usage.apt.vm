Usage

 The following examples describe the basic usage of the Checkstyle Plugin.

* Generate Checkstyle Report As Part of the Project Reports

  To generate the Checkstyle report as part of the Project Reports, add the
  Checkstyle Plugin in the <<<\<reporting\>>>> section
  of your <<<pom.xml>>>.

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

  Then, execute the site phase to generate the report.

+-----+
mvn site
+-----+

* Generate Checkstyle Report As Standalone

  You can also generate the Checkstyle report by explicitly executing the <<<checkstyle:checkstyle>>> goal from the
  command line. It is not required to specify the Checkstyle Plugin in your
  <<<pom.xml>>> unless you want to use a specific configuration.

+-----+
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
+-----+

* Configure the Checkstyle Plugin

** Maven 3

  As per {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/MAVEN/maven-3x-compatibility-notes.html}Maven 3 Compatibility Notes}}
  to configure the Checkstyle Plugin, you need to the add it in the <<<\<build\>>>> section of your <<<pom.xml>>> as
  shown in the sample below.

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <enableRulesSummary>false</enableRulesSummary>
           ...
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

** Maven 2

  You may need to duplicate some configuration details between the <<<\<build\>>>> section and the <<<\<reporting\>>>>
  section, depending on whether you use checkstyle as part of the build, part of site, or both.
